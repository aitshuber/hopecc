In a world that often feels broken, chaotic, and filled with imperfections, it can be easy to lose sight of the truth that God's original design for creation was one of wholeness, beauty, and goodness. Genesis 1:31 declares, "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good." This powerful statement reminds us that despite the brokenness we may experience in our lives and in the world around us, God's ultimate intention and desire for His creation is one of completeness, harmony, and flourishing. As we seek to embrace God's perfect design and find wholeness in our own lives, we can experience the rich blessings of living in alignment with His purposes and plans.

## The Struggle of Brokenness

Before we explore the beauty and promise of God's perfect design, it's important to acknowledge the very real struggle of brokenness that we all face in this fallen world. Sin has marred and distorted God's original creation, leaving us with a sense of incompleteness, dysfunction, and pain.

### The Brokenness of Our Bodies

One area where we may experience brokenness is in our physical bodies. Whether it's through illness, injury, or the natural effects of aging, our bodies can often feel like a source of limitation, frustration, and even suffering. We may struggle with chronic pain, disability, or a sense of disconnection from our physical selves, longing for the wholeness and vitality that we believe God intended for us.

> "Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day." - 2 Corinthians 4:16

### The Brokenness of Our Relationships

Another area of brokenness that we may face is in our relationships with others. Sin has created division, conflict, and hurt in our connections with family, friends, and even fellow believers. We may struggle with feelings of rejection, betrayal, or loneliness, longing for the deep, authentic community that God designed us to experience.

> "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone." - Romans 12:18

### The Brokenness of Our World

Finally, we may also feel the weight of brokenness in the world around us. From natural disasters and environmental destruction to political strife and social injustice, the effects of sin and the fall can be seen in every corner of creation. We may feel overwhelmed by the suffering, darkness, and despair that seems to pervade our culture and our planet, wondering if wholeness and redemption are truly possible.

> "We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time." - Romans 8:22

## The Beauty of God's Perfect Design

In the face of these various forms of brokenness, Genesis 1:31 offers a powerful reminder of the beauty, goodness, and wholeness that were present in God's original creation. When we look to God's perfect design, we can find hope, healing, and purpose, even in the midst of a fallen world.

### The Goodness of the Physical World

One key aspect of God's perfect design is the inherent goodness and beauty of the physical world. When God looked upon His creation, He declared it to be "very good," reflecting His own character and nature. This means that our bodies, the natural world, and the material universe are not inherently evil or lesser than the spiritual realm, but are part of God's good gift to us.

> "For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer." - 1 Timothy 4:4-5

### The Interdependence of Relationships

Another essential component of God's perfect design is the interdependence and harmony of relationships. From the very beginning, God created human beings to live in community with one another, reflecting the relational nature of the Trinity. When we embrace God's design for authentic, sacrificial, and loving relationships, we experience the joy and fulfillment that come from living in connection with others.

> "Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up." - Ecclesiastes 4:9-10

### The Purpose of Stewardship

Finally, God's perfect design includes the purpose and responsibility of stewardship. When God created human beings in His image, He gave them the task of caring for and cultivating the world He had made. This means that we have a sacred calling to use our gifts, talents, and resources to honor God, serve others, and work towards the flourishing of all creation.

> "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." - Genesis 2:15

## Practical Steps for Embracing Wholeness

While the vision of God's perfect design is beautiful and inspiring, it can still be challenging to embrace wholeness in the midst of a broken world. Here are some practical steps we can take to align ourselves with God's purposes and experience greater wholeness in our lives:

### Cultivate Gratitude and Wonder

One of the most powerful ways to embrace God's perfect design is to cultivate a spirit of gratitude and wonder for the world He has made. Taking time to notice and appreciate the beauty, complexity, and goodness of creation can help us to see beyond the brokenness and catch glimpses of God's original intention. Practices like keeping a gratitude journal, spending time in nature, or engaging in creative expression can all be ways to nurture a sense of awe and thankfulness for God's handiwork.

> "The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands." - Psalm 19:1

### Seek Healing and Restoration

Another important step in embracing wholeness is to actively seek healing and restoration in the areas of our lives that feel broken or incomplete. This may involve seeking professional help for physical or mental health struggles, working towards reconciliation in strained relationships, or engaging in acts of justice and compassion to address the brokenness in our world. As we pursue wholeness and healing in our own lives, we become agents of God's redemptive work in the world around us.

> "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!" - 2 Corinthians 5:17

### Cultivate a Lifestyle of Stewardship

Finally, embracing wholeness involves cultivating a lifestyle of stewardship and purpose. When we recognize that our lives, gifts, and resources are ultimately entrusted to us by God, we can begin to use them in ways that honor Him and contribute to the flourishing of His creation. This may involve using our talents to serve others, making choices that promote the health and well-being of our bodies and the planet, or investing our time and resources in causes that reflect God's heart for justice and compassion.

> "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms." - 1 Peter 4:10

## The Hope of Redemption

As we seek to embrace God's perfect design and find wholeness in a broken world, it's important to remember that the ultimate hope of redemption and restoration lies not in our own efforts, but in the finished work of Christ on the cross. Through His death and resurrection, Jesus has made a way for us to be reconciled to God, to one another, and to the world around us. He is the one who will one day make all things new, wiping away every tear and healing every wound.

> "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." - Revelation 21:4

This means that even as we strive towards wholeness and healing in our own lives and in the world around us, we can do so with a sense of hope, peace, and anticipation. We know that God's perfect design will one day be fully restored, and that we have the incredible privilege of participating in His redemptive work here and now.

## Conclusion

The truth that God's original creation was one of wholeness, beauty, and goodness is a powerful reminder of His ultimate intention and desire for our lives and for the world around us. Despite the brokenness and pain that we may experience, we can find hope and purpose in embracing God's perfect design and working towards the restoration of all things. As we cultivate gratitude, seek healing, and steward our lives for God's glory, we can experience glimpses of the wholeness and flourishing that God intends for us. May we hold fast to the promise of redemption and renewal, trusting in the One who is making all things new, and may we find joy and meaning in aligning our lives with His perfect purposes and plans.
