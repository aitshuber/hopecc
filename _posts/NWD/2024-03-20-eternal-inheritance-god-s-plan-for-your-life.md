In a world marked by uncertainty, change, and the constant pursuit of temporary pleasures and successes, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture – the eternal purpose and plan that God has for our lives. We may find ourselves grappling with questions of identity, meaning, and ultimate significance, wondering what our lives are truly meant to be about and where we fit into the grand story of God's redemptive work in the world. However, as followers of Christ, we have access to a profound truth that has the power to anchor our souls, guide our steps, and fill us with an unshakable sense of hope, purpose, and spiritual vitality – the truth of our eternal inheritance in Him.

In Psalm 37:28, we are reminded of this beautiful promise: "For the Lord loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed; the offspring of the wicked will perish." This verse serves as a powerful declaration of God's steadfast love for His children, His commitment to preserving and protecting those who trust in Him, and His ultimate plan to bring justice, restoration, and eternal life to all who belong to Him. As we learn to fix our eyes on this eternal inheritance and align our lives with God's purposes, we can experience a deep sense of spiritual rest, renewal, and unshakable confidence in the midst of life's challenges and uncertainties.

## The Challenges of Living for Temporary Things

### The Pursuit of Earthly Success and Pleasure

One of the most significant obstacles to discovering and embracing God's eternal plan for our lives is the allure of earthly success, wealth, and pleasure. In a culture that often equates worth and happiness with material possessions, social status, and the pursuit of personal fulfillment, it can be easy to get caught up in the quest for temporary, fleeting satisfactions, neglecting the deeper, eternal purposes that God has for us.

### The Fear of Missing Out and Conforming to the World

Another common challenge to living for eternal things is the fear of missing out or being left behind in a world that is constantly moving, changing, and redefining what is valuable or desirable. When we are bombarded with messages and pressures to conform to the world's standards, priorities, and expectations, it can be tempting to compromise our faith, values, or God-given calling in order to fit in, feel accepted, or avoid the discomfort of standing out.

### The Struggle with Doubt and Discouragement

Finally, the struggle with doubt, discouragement, or spiritual weariness can be a significant barrier to embracing God's eternal plan and inheritance for our lives. When we face trials, setbacks, or seasons of waiting and uncertainty, it can be easy to question God's goodness, faithfulness, or specific purposes for us, leading us to lose sight of the bigger picture and the unshakable hope we have in Christ.

## The Promise of God's Eternal Inheritance

In the face of these challenges and temptations, God invites us to fix our eyes on the eternal inheritance He has prepared for us, trusting in His love, wisdom, and sovereign plan for our lives. Here are three key truths that we can draw from Psalm 37:28 and the larger context of Scripture:

### 1\. God Loves and Preserves His Faithful Ones

> "For the Lord loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones." (Psalm 37:28a, NIV)

The first and most foundational truth that we can cling to is that God's love for His children is steadfast, unshakable, and eternal. When we place our faith in Christ and enter into a covenant relationship with Him, we become part of His family, His treasured possession, and the recipients of His unfailing love and protection. No matter what challenges, struggles, or opposition we may face in this life, we can trust that God will never abandon or forsake us, but will always be with us, fighting for us, and working all things together for our ultimate good and His glory.

### 2\. God Will Bring Justice and Restoration

> "Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed; the offspring of the wicked will perish." (Psalm 37:28b, NIV)

Another powerful promise that we can hold onto is that God is a God of justice and restoration, who will ultimately right every wrong, vindicate His people, and bring about the full redemption and renewal of all creation. While we may experience the painful effects of sin, brokenness, and injustice in this present age, we can have confidence that God's eternal plan involves the complete destruction of evil, the restoration of all that is good and beautiful, and the establishment of His perfect kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.

### 3\. God Has an Eternal Purpose and Inheritance for Us

> "I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus." (Philippians 3:14, NIV)

Finally, the promise of God's eternal inheritance assures us that our lives are not random, meaningless, or without ultimate significance, but that we have been created and called by God for a specific, eternal purpose that is wrapped up in His redemptive plan for the world. As we seek to know and follow Jesus, to cultivate a deeper relationship with Him, and to use our gifts, passions, and experiences to serve others and advance His kingdom, we can have confidence that we are living into the eternal inheritance and unshakable hope that is ours in Christ.

## Practical Steps for Embracing God's Eternal Plan

While the promise of God's eternal love, justice, and purpose for our lives is an incredible source of hope and encouragement, learning to consistently fix our eyes on this inheritance and align our lives with His plan is a daily choice and a lifelong journey. Here are a few practical steps that we can take to cultivate a heart that is anchored in eternity and committed to living out God's purposes:

### 1\. Cultivate a Deep, Abiding Relationship with Jesus

> "Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me." (John 15:4, ESV)

One of the most foundational ways to embrace God's eternal plan for our lives is to prioritize a deep, abiding relationship with Jesus Christ. By spending regular time in prayer, worship, and meditation on His Word, and by seeking to know and love Him more each day, we create space for His Spirit to transform us, guide us, and align our desires and priorities with His eternal purposes. As we learn to abide in Christ and allow His life to flow through us, we become conduits of His love, light, and redemptive work in the world.

### 2\. Seek God's Wisdom and Guidance for Your Life

> "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." (Proverbs 3:5-6, ESV)

Another key to living into God's eternal plan is to actively seek His wisdom, guidance, and direction for every area of our lives. Rather than relying on our own limited understanding, succumbing to the pressures and expectations of the world, or making decisions based on temporary pleasures or fears, we are called to submit our lives to God's leading, to trust in His goodness and sovereignty, and to walk in obedience to His Word and His Spirit. As we learn to acknowledge God in all our ways and surrender our plans and desires to Him, we can have confidence that He will guide us into the fullness of His eternal purposes for us.

### 3\. Live with an Eternal Perspective and Hope

> "Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things." (Colossians 3:2, NIV)

Finally, embracing God's eternal plan for our lives involves cultivating a mindset and lifestyle that is oriented towards heaven, rather than being consumed by the temporary, fleeting things of this world. By regularly meditating on the reality of eternity, the promise of our future inheritance in Christ, and the ultimate restoration and renewal of all things, we can find the strength, perseverance, and hope we need to live with purpose, faithfulness, and joy in the midst of life's challenges and uncertainties. As we learn to set our minds on things above and store up treasures in heaven, we become a living testament to the unshakable hope and eternal significance that is found in Christ alone.

## The Promise of Spiritual Rest and Renewal

As we learn to fix our eyes on God's eternal love, justice, and purpose for our lives, cultivating a deep relationship with Jesus, seeking His wisdom and guidance, and living with an eternal perspective, we can have confidence in the promise of spiritual rest and renewal that He offers to all who trust in Him. In Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus extends this beautiful invitation: "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

When we come to Jesus and align our lives with His eternal purposes, we discover a rest and renewal that goes beyond mere physical or emotional comfort. We find that our souls are refreshed, our minds are renewed, and our hearts are filled with an unshakable peace and joy that comes from knowing that we are loved, cherished, and destined for an eternal inheritance in Christ.

Moreover, as we live into the reality of God's eternal plan and allow His purposes to shape our lives, we become a powerful witness to the hope, meaning, and abundant life that can be found in Him alone. Our lives become a testament to the goodness, faithfulness, and transformative power of a God who loves us with an everlasting love, and who invites us to be part of His eternal story of redemption and restoration.

So if you find yourself longing for a deeper sense of purpose, significance, and spiritual vitality today, know that God has an eternal plan and inheritance for your life that is far greater than anything this world has to offer. Cultivate a deep relationship with Jesus, seek His wisdom and guidance, and live with an eternal perspective and hope. As you do, you will discover the soul-deep rest, the life-changing renewal, and the unshakable confidence that can only be found in Him – the One who holds your future, your purpose, and your eternal inheritance in His loving hands.
