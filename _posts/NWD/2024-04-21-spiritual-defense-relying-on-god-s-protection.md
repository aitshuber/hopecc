In a world filled with challenges, temptations, and spiritual attacks, it's easy to feel vulnerable and unprotected. We may face opposition from others, struggle with our own weaknesses and sins, or feel overwhelmed by the darkness and brokenness around us. However, in Jeremiah 15:20, God offers a powerful promise of protection and defense for His people: "I will make you a wall to this people, a fortified wall of bronze; they will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue and save you." This verse speaks to the incredible reality that when we rely on God's strength and presence, we have a spiritual defense that is unshakable and impenetrable.

## The Reality of Spiritual Warfare

Before we explore the comfort and assurance found in Jeremiah 15:20, it's important to acknowledge the very real presence of spiritual warfare in our lives. The Bible consistently reminds us that we are engaged in a battle not just against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

### The Enemy's Tactics

One aspect of spiritual warfare that can be particularly challenging is the diversity and subtlety of the enemy's tactics. Satan, who is described as a roaring lion seeking someone to devour (1 Peter 5:8), uses a variety of strategies to deceive, discourage, and derail us in our faith.

> "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places." - Ephesians 6:12

### The Consequences of Sin

Another reality of spiritual warfare is the consequences of our own sin and disobedience. When we choose to go our own way and rebel against God's commands, we open ourselves up to the destructive power of sin and give the enemy a foothold in our lives.

> "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death." - James 1:14-15

### The Opposition of the World

Finally, spiritual warfare can also manifest in the opposition and hostility we face from the world around us. As followers of Jesus, we are called to live counter-culturally and to stand for truth and righteousness, even when it is unpopular or costly.

> "If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you." - John 15:19

## The Promise of God's Protection

In the face of these very real spiritual battles and challenges, Jeremiah 15:20 offers a powerful promise of God's protection and defense. When we rely on His strength and presence, we have a spiritual fortification that is unbreakable and unassailable.

### The Strength of God's Wall

The first key to understanding the promise of protection in Jeremiah 15:20 is the strength and durability of God's wall. The verse describes this wall as being made of bronze – a strong, resistant metal that was often used for defensive purposes in ancient times. This imagery speaks to the impenetrable nature of God's protection and the futility of the enemy's attacks against it.

> "The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold." - Psalm 18:2

### The Presence of God's Spirit

Another essential aspect of God's protection is the presence of His Spirit with us. Jeremiah 15:20 says that God Himself will be with us to rescue and save us, and this promise is echoed throughout Scripture. When we have the Holy Spirit living within us, we have access to a spiritual power and wisdom that enables us to stand firm against the enemy's schemes.

> "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." - Acts 1:8

### The Purpose of God's Protection

Finally, it's important to recognize that God's protection is not just for our own comfort or safety, but for His greater purposes and glory. Jeremiah 15:20 speaks of being a wall "to this people" – in other words, our spiritual defense is meant to be a witness and a testimony to others of God's power and faithfulness.

> "So we can confidently say, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me?'" - Hebrews 13:6

## Practical Steps for Relying on God's Protection

While the promise of God's protection in Jeremiah 15:20 is incredibly reassuring, it can still be challenging to know how to practically rely on that protection in our daily lives. Here are some practical steps we can take to actively trust in and depend on God's spiritual defense:

### Put on the Full Armor of God

One of the most important ways to rely on God's protection is to put on the full armor of God, as described in Ephesians 6:10-18. This includes the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shoes of the gospel of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. By daily putting on this spiritual armor through prayer and the study of God's Word, we can stand firm against the enemy's attacks.

> "Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm." - Ephesians 6:13

### Cultivate a Life of Prayer

Another key to relying on God's protection is to cultivate a consistent and fervent life of prayer. When we bring our fears, struggles, and challenges before God, we invite His presence and power into our lives in a tangible way. Prayer is also a means of discerning God's will and aligning our hearts with His purposes, which is essential for standing firm in the face of spiritual opposition.

> "Praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints." - Ephesians 6:18

### Seek Accountability and Community

Finally, seeking out the support and accountability of a Christian community can be a significant way to rely on God's protection. When we surround ourselves with others who can pray for us, encourage us, and speak truth into our lives, we are better equipped to withstand the enemy's attacks and to persevere in our faith.

> "And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near." - Hebrews 10:24-25

## The Benefits of God's Protection

When we choose to rely on God's protection and to trust in His spiritual defense, we open ourselves up to a range of benefits and blessings that can transform our lives and our witness.

### Greater Peace and Security

One of the most significant benefits of relying on God's protection is a greater sense of peace and security in the midst of life's challenges and uncertainties. When we know that we are held in the strong and loving hands of our Heavenly Father, we can face even the darkest and most difficult circumstances with confidence and hope.

> "You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you." - Isaiah 26:3

### Increased Spiritual Power

Another benefit of relying on God's protection is an increased sense of spiritual power and authority. When we stand firm in the strength of the Lord and resist the enemy's attacks, we experience a greater measure of God's Spirit and a deeper intimacy with Him. We become more attuned to His voice and more responsive to His leading, and we see His power at work in and through us in remarkable ways.

> "For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power." - 1 Corinthians 4:20

### Expanded Influence and Impact

Finally, relying on God's protection can lead to an expanded influence and impact in the world around us. When others see the way we stand firm in our faith, even in the face of opposition and difficulty, it can be a powerful testimony to the reality and goodness of God. Our lives become a living demonstration of the gospel, and we have opportunities to share the hope and truth of Jesus with those who are seeking and struggling.

> "In your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect." - 1 Peter 3:15

## Conclusion

The reality of spiritual warfare and the challenges we face in this life can be daunting and overwhelming, but the promise of God's protection in Jeremiah 15:20 offers a powerful source of comfort and strength. When we choose to rely on God's spiritual defense and to stand firm in His presence and power, we have a wall of protection that is unshakable and impenetrable. As we put on the full armor of God, cultivate a life of prayer, and seek out the support of Christian community, we can experience greater peace, spiritual power, and influence in the world around us. May we hold fast to the truth that our God is a mighty fortress and a strong deliverer, and may we find in Him the ultimate source of protection, strength, and victory in every battle we face.
