In the busyness and distractions of modern life, it can be easy to lose sight of the brevity and preciousness of our days on earth. We may find ourselves caught up in the pursuit of temporal goals, material possessions, or fleeting pleasures, neglecting to consider the eternal significance of our choices and the ultimate purpose for which we were created. However, as Christians, we are called to a different perspective – one that recognizes the value of each day as a gift from God and seeks to live with wisdom, intentionality, and a heart surrendered to His purposes.

In Psalm 90:12, Moses offers a profound prayer that encapsulates this perspective: "Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom." This simple yet powerful request serves as an invitation to approach life with a sense of urgency, gratitude, and purposeful living, recognizing that our time on earth is limited and that each moment is an opportunity to glorify God and invest in eternity.

## The Temptations of a Life Without Purpose

### The Pursuit of Temporal Pleasures

One of the most common temptations that can distract us from living wisely and purposefully is the pursuit of temporal pleasures and worldly desires. In a culture that often glorifies instant gratification, self-indulgence, and the accumulation of material possessions, it can be easy to become consumed with the quest for happiness, comfort, and satisfaction in things that ultimately fade away.

### The Illusion of Immortality

Another obstacle to numbering our days and gaining wisdom is the illusion of immortality that often pervades our thinking and decision-making. When we are young, healthy, and full of energy, it can be tempting to live as though we have all the time in the world, putting off important decisions, neglecting our spiritual growth, and failing to consider the eternal consequences of our actions.

### The Distractions of Busyness and Noise

Finally, the constant distractions of busyness, noise, and information overload that characterize modern life can make it challenging to cultivate a heart of wisdom and purposeful living. When our schedules are packed with activities, our minds are bombarded with media and messages, and our attention is fragmented by countless demands and interruptions, it can be difficult to find the space and stillness needed to reflect on the deeper questions of life and to align our priorities with God's purposes.

## The Blessings of Numbering Our Days

In the face of these temptations and distractions, the prayer of Psalm 90:12 offers a powerful invitation to embrace the blessings of a life lived with wisdom and purpose. Here are just a few of the incredible benefits of learning to number our days:

### 1\. A Heart of Wisdom

#### "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding." (Proverbs 9:10, NIV)

The first and most foundational blessing of numbering our days is the cultivation of a heart of wisdom – a deep, abiding understanding of who God is, what He desires for our lives, and how we can live in alignment with His purposes. As we learn to approach each day with a sense of reverence, gratitude, and surrender to God, we begin to see the world and our place in it through the lens of His eternal perspective, gaining insight, discernment, and a clarity of purpose that can only come from knowing and walking with Him.

### 2\. A Life of Intentionality and Purpose

#### "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." (Ephesians 2:10, NIV)

Another powerful blessing of numbering our days is the opportunity to live with greater intentionality and purpose, recognizing that each moment is a gift from God and an opportunity to glorify Him and make a difference in the world. When we understand that our time on earth is limited and that we have been created for a specific purpose, we can begin to approach each day with a sense of focus, urgency, and a desire to use our gifts, talents, and resources to advance God's kingdom and bless others.

### 3\. A Legacy of Eternal Significance

#### "Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal." (Matthew 6:20, NIV)

Finally, learning to number our days and live with wisdom and purpose enables us to leave a legacy of eternal significance – a life that is not measured by temporal accomplishments or material possessions, but by the impact we have had on others and the investments we have made in the things that matter most to God. When we prioritize our relationship with Him, our service to others, and our growth in Christ-like character, we can have confidence that our lives will bear fruit that lasts long beyond our earthly days.

## Practical Steps for Embracing Wisdom and Purposeful Living

While the blessings of numbering our days and living with wisdom and purpose are truly incredible, learning to embrace this perspective is a daily choice and a lifelong journey. Here are a few practical steps we can take to cultivate a heart of wisdom and purposeful living:

### 1\. Cultivate a Lifestyle of Prayer and Reflection

#### "Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed." (Mark 1:35, NIV)

One of the most powerful ways to gain a heart of wisdom and align our lives with God's purposes is to cultivate a lifestyle of regular prayer and reflection. By setting aside daily time to commune with God, to seek His face and His will, and to examine our hearts and priorities in light of His Word, we create space for the Holy Spirit to speak to us, guide us, and transform us from the inside out.

### 2\. Seek Wise Counsel and Accountability

#### "Walk with the wise and become wise, for a companion of fools suffers harm." (Proverbs 13:20, NIV)

Another key to living with wisdom and purpose is to surround ourselves with wise counsel and accountability, seeking out mentors, friends, and spiritual leaders who can speak truth into our lives, challenge us to grow, and help us stay focused on the things that matter most. By regularly sharing our struggles, our dreams, and our decisions with trusted advisors, we can gain invaluable perspective, avoid pitfalls, and stay on track with God's purposes for our lives.

### 3\. Live with Eternity in Mind

#### "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." (2 Corinthians 4:18, NIV)

Finally, embracing wisdom and purposeful living requires a fundamental shift in our perspective – a conscious choice to live with eternity in mind, recognizing that our ultimate home is not in this world, but in the presence of God forever. When we orient our lives around this eternal reality, making decisions and investing our time and resources in light of what will last beyond this life, we can experience a sense of peace, purpose, and unshakable joy that transcends our earthly circumstances.

## The Promise of Rest and Renewal

As we learn to number our days and live with wisdom and purpose, we can have confidence in the promise of rest and renewal that God offers to those who seek Him. In Matthew 11:28-30, Jesus extends this beautiful invitation: "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."

When we come to Jesus, surrendering our lives to His purposes and learning to walk in His wisdom, we discover a rest and renewal that goes beyond physical refreshment or temporary relief. We find a soul-deep sense of peace, purpose, and unshakable joy that flows from knowing and living for the One who created us, loves us, and holds our days in His hands.

Moreover, as we learn to number our days and live with wisdom and intentionality, we become a powerful witness to the goodness and faithfulness of God, inviting others to discover the abundant life that can only be found in Him. Our lives become a testament to the beauty and significance of a heart surrendered to His purposes, a legacy that will endure long after our earthly days have ended.

So if you find yourself longing for a life of greater wisdom, purpose, and eternal significance today, know that God is inviting you to number your days and seek Him with all your heart. Cultivate a lifestyle of prayer and reflection, seek out wise counsel and accountability, and live with eternity in mind. As you do, you will discover the rest, the renewal, and the unshakable joy that can only be found in a life aligned with the purposes and wisdom of a good and loving God.
