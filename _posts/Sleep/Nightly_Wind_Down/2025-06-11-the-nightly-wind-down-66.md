Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer. I cry aloud to the Lord, before Him I tell my trouble.

And again, I cry aloud to the Lord, before Him I tell my trouble.

With an easy awareness, begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening and enjoying the sounds. Not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness back to the body, noticing the weight of the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress, being mindful to stay present. In this moment,

let yourself unwind and naturally relax in the presence of God.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done, is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice, deep breaths.

Allow your breathing to relax the mind.

Feel the body become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room,

not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, remember, that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

As your awareness begins to drift deeper, rest into the calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God.

Take this verse with you. I cry aloud to the Lord. Before Him, I tell my trouble,

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go. In your presence, I trust your plan for my life.
