Begin by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. Let my words and my thoughts be pleasing to you.

And again, let my words and my thoughts be pleasing to you.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety,

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities, just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless,

in through the nose and out through the mouth,

feeling life enter your body. As you breathe in,

inhale, feel how the body expands, then slowly Exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose

and feel the body fall. With each exhale,

with each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels.

Allow your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes itself.

And now let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take this verse with you. Let my words So we're going to start with the prayer. Come on up. What's for dinner? Yeah okay. Meal, dinner, what vege? Salad. Ok restaurant, its time to eat something. 2nd meal?
