Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

I am the vine and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me and I to you, you will produce plenty of fruit.

And again, I am the vine and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me and I to you, you will produce plenty of fruit.

Now, bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale.

Three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale.

Counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again. Counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath. Next,

exhale. Allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, Let your mind relax.

When it feels natural, begin releasing the tension in your hands, shoulders, and neck.

Let go of that stress.

Release your anxieties and worries to God.

Let go of your grip on control.

Take a big, deep breath in.

Release your stress.

Let go of your frustrations.

Let it all go on the exhale.

We aren't holding on to the thoughts, we're just letting them release.

Now bring your awareness to the way the body feels.

Let the body relax and release.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention to the heart.

Feel the heartbeat,

just noticing it.

Allow that natural rhythm and stillness to relax the body.

Allow yourself to relax into the loving presence of God.

Take this verse with you.

I am the vine and you are the branches. If you stay joined to me, And I to you, you will produce plenty of fruit.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
