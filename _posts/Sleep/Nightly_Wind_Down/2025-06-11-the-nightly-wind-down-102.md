Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

Even as you grow old and your hair turns gray, I'll keep carrying you.

And again. Even as you grow old and your hair turns gray, I'll keep carrying you.

Bring your attention to the way the breath feels.

Let it settle into a natural rhythm,

effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels to just breathe.

With each exhale, let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release and unlock.

Feel the effects of gravity on the body, letting gravity pull the body down into the bed or the chair.

Now, gently bring your attention to your feelings or emotions,

just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today.

not engaging with those emotions, remembering that we can leave those feelings right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts, and then let them be.

Rest into that deeper sense of calm that can only be found in God's love.

You're inviting God to bring calm over your body, to bring peace into your spirit,

resting into your true nature, a child of God.

Gently. Bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Just noticing any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin

or the weight of the body in the bed.

Follow your breath and notice how it changes the body.

The inhales expanding the body,

and the exhales relaxing the body.

Follow it as it comes in through the nose and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance.

Try not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace that's already present in your heart.

Let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love and deep rest. Allow your mind to relax. To find refuge in God.

Take this verse with you. Even as you grow old and your hair turns gray, I'll keep carrying you.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
