Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

You are blessed when you care.

And again, you are blessed when you care.

Bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders,

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs. The knees,

relax the calves, down to the ankles.

Bring your attention Back to the breath,

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Take a few nice big breaths in.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go, there is nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away, and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation. in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing.

Effortlessly rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. You are blessed when you care.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
