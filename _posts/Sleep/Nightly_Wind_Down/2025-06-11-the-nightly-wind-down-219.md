Begin by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Think about things that are pure and lovely, and dwell on the fine, good things in others. Think about all you can praise God for and be glad about it.

And again, think about things that are pure and lovely and dwell on the fine, good things in others. Think about all you can praise God for and be glad about.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body.

Not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them.

Taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe. A place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice How your body feels.

Consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety.

Surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice deep breaths. breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless,

in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale, feel how the body expands, then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air. As it travels in through the nose

and feel the body fall, with each exhale,

with each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels. Allow

your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing. And

now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take this verse with you. Think about things that are pure and lovely, and dwell on the fine, good things in others. Think about all you can praise God for and be glad about.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
