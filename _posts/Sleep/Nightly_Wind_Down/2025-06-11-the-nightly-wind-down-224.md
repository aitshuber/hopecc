Begin by getting comfortable, and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to relax, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

By your mighty power, I can walk through any devastation, and you will keep me alive.

And again, by your mighty power. I can walk through any devastation and you will keep me alive.

Now bring your attention to the breath.

Taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths.

In through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling. letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale. Feel

the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face,

just relaxing and releasing.

Now let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm.

Now bring your attention to the way the body feels.

Notice your breath.

Allow the inhales to expand the body.

Notice how the exhales make you feel.

Feel the body relax and become heavier.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Soften the forehead down the front of the face.

Allow the neck to relax and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the temples.

Feel the weight of the body so the arms become heavy.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the bones become heavy.

Letting the breath become natural.

Allow the whole body to soften and release.

Now, give yourself a moment to relax and totally let go.

Take this verse with you. By your mighty power, I can walk through any devastation, and you will keep me alive.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
