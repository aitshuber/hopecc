Let's begin by consciously turning off the body.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close. Like the sun sets,

calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Don't worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank Him for all He has done.

And again, don't worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank Him for all He has done.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension in the hands. Let

the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip Relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release,

the shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs,

relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax.

Almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go. Nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body,

not judging. Just noticing.

Now, bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels. Just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale,

three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to ten and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath

on the next exhale, Allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, Let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. Don't worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank Him for all He has done.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
