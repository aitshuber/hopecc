Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.

And again, for you were once darkness. But now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands. Letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders falling away from the ears,

feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs,

relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go. Know where to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Now, bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels. just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale

and two on the exhale.

Three, On the next inhale

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to 10 and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go. In your presence, I trust your plan for my life.
