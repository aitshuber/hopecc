Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer,

I have loved you with an everlasting love.

And again, I have loved you with an everlasting love.

Now let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands. Letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

If you need a deep breath, take it. Keep it easy and natural.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Allow yourself to release those feelings of tightness and tension.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus.

Just allow yourself to be.

With an easy awareness, begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening. and enjoying the sounds. Not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness back to the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress. being mindful to stay present in this moment.

Let yourself unwind and naturally relax in the presence of God.

As your awareness begins to drift deeper, rest into the calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God. Take this verse with you, I have loved you with an everlasting love.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
