Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

Calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Let everything you say be good and helpful so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.

And again. Let everything you say be good and helpful so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice, deep breaths.

Allow your breathing to relax the mind.

Feel the body become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body. and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room,

not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, Remember, that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the sounds.

And for a moment or two, effortlessly, allow your awareness. To rest,

bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders,

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs, the knees,

relax the calves, down to the ankles.

Bring your attention Back to the breath,

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale.

Take this verse with you. Let everything you say be good and helpful so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
