Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest,

and when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. And again, cast

all your anxiety on Him, Because he cares for you.

Now bring your attention to the breath.

Taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth. Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling.

letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale. Feel

the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you. in the body.

Not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them.

Taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe. A place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in him,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax. And notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety.

Surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing. and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take this verse with you. Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go. In your presence, I trust your plan for my life.
