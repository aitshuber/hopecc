Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close. Like the sun sets,

calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. God, create a pure heart in me and make my spirit strong again.

Again. God, create a pure heart in me. and make my spirit strong again.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note of the emotions, and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security. In Him,

in this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, That's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety,

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There is nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away. And that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing.

Effortlessly rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. God, create a pure heart in me and make my spirit strong again.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
