Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer. The Lord will guide you continually. You will be like a well watered garden, like an ever flowing spring.

And again, the Lord will guide you continually. You will be like a well watered garden, like an ever flowing spring.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax. And the joints release,

the shoulders falling away from the ears,

feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs,

relaxing and letting go,

allow the legs to be heavy,

allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Now, bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy. Body,

relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One, on the inhale.

And 2 on the exhale.

3 on the next inhale.

And 4 on the next exhale.

Counting up to 10, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from 1.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale. Allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, Let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. The Lord will guide you continually. You will be like a well watered garden, like an ever flowing spring.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
