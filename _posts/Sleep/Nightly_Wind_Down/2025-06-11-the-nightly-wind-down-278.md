Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.

And again. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be open to you.

Now, take some nice, deep breaths.

In through the nose, and out through the mouth.

Just watching the breath.

Watching the rise and the fall of the chest.

Listening to the sounds. of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions,

just taking note of them, and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place where you feel loved.

Feel that sense of natural peace that can only be found in God's presence.

Bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils and into the chest. and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you, and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination.

Allow your awareness to rest. With the presence of God,

take this verse with you. Keep on seeking and you will find keep on knocking and the door will be open to you.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
