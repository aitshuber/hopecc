Begin by getting comfortable and allowing your body to relax.

As you begin to feel your body releasing, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

A thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy. But I come to give life, life that is full and good.

And again, a thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy. But I come to give life, life that is full and good.

Now bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale.

Three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale.

Counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax, become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

With an easy awareness, begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening and enjoying the sounds. Not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness back to the body. Noticing the weight of the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress, being mindful to stay present in this moment.

Let yourself unwind and naturally relax in the presence of God.

As your awareness begins to drift deeper, rest into the calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God.

Take this verse with you. A thief comes to steal, kill, and destroy, but I come to give life, life that is full and good.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
