Let's start by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. Lord, You know everything there is to know about me.

And again, Lord, You know everything there is to know about me.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless,

in through the nose and out through the mouth,

feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale. Feel how the body expands. Then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose

and feel the body fall. With each exhale,

with each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels.

Allow your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes itself

with an easy awareness. Begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening and enjoying the sounds, not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness back to the body. Noticing the weight of the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress. Being mindful to stay present in this moment.

Let yourself unwind. And naturally relax in the presence of God.

As your awareness begins to drift deeper, rest into the calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God.

Take this verse with you. Lord, you know everything there is to know about me.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
