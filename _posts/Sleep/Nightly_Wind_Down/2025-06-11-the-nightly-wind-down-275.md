Let's start by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

When God lives and breathes in you, you are delivered from that dead life.

And again, when God lives and breathes in you, you are delivered from that dead life.

Bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften. all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes,

soften the throat and the back of the neck,

soften the collarbone,

the shoulders

and the arms,

releasing the elbows,

let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs, the knees,

Relax the calves down to the ankles.

Gently bring your awareness to the feeling of the body,

just noticing any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin

or the weight of the body in the bed.

Follow your breath and notice how it changes the body.

The inhales expanding the body

and the exhales relaxing the body.

Follow it as it comes in through the nose and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance.

Try not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace that's already present in your heart.

Let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love and deep rest. Allow your mind to find refuge. In God,

take this verse with you.

When God lives and breathes in you, you are delivered from that dead life.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
