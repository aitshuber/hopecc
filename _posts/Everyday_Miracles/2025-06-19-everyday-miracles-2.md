One of my favorite memories growing up was staying up late in my room, listening to music on my lime Green iPod Mini when I was supposed to be sleeping.

This was a middle school when I was really starting to form opinions about what I liked and what I didn't. My favorite band from that time was The Beatles. I was obsessed. I listened to The Beatles so much that when I was riding with my mom in the car, she would only allow me to play The Beatles on Friday because she was so sick of listening to them.

When I was young, I loved Paul McCartney, but as I got older, I found myself drawn to George Harrison, the quiet Beatle. He was probably the least famous of The Beatles, but he wrote some of their best songs. Interestingly, George was never respected as a songwriter in the same way that John and Paul were, but in my opinion, he had the best solo career.

After The Beatles broke up, my favorite album of his was a triple album called All Things Must Pass. The title track of the album has the lyrics, sunrise doesn't last all morning. A cloud burst doesn't last all day. Seems my love is up and is left you with no warning. It's not always going to be this gray.

All things must pass. All things must pass away. In Hebrews, they say something similar. Everyone must die once and after that be judged by God. In Psalms, they say it like this. Teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom. It's a strange thing to think about all the things that we care about, all the things that we work towards, they're temporary.

They'll eventually be washed away and forgotten, and it's, it's so hard to live our lives with open hands, but in realizing that everything is temporary. It grants us the freedom to love and appreciate every moment that we are given by God

today. I'm thankful for things passing because it's a reminder of why we love them so much in the first place. You've been listening to Everyday Miracles by Hope, mindfulness, and Prayer.
