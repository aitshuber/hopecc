It doesn't it feel like every few weeks we look at the way we've been living and we make some promise to ourselves that we're going to quit eating so bad, or maybe we're gonna exercise more. I know for me, candy is a struggle. I'll make some big proclamation to my family and friends that from now on I'm gonna be healthy starting tomorrow.

Well, maybe after that wedding on Friday. It is shocking how quickly we can change from determination to convincing ourselves that this time it's okay, but next time it'll be different. Jesus told a story about three men who were invited to a King's wedding banquet. All three of the men declined and had excuses as to why they couldn't go.

The first man told the king that he wanted to go see a field that he had just purchased. This sounds a little fishy. I mean, who buys property without seeing it first? The second guy said he wanted to work with the ox. He had just purchased. I mean, this ox was not going anywhere. This could have waited, and the third man said he had just gotten married.

Not a strong excuse, but at least this was plausible. But this is what Jesus said of the three men. The Kingdom of Heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son. All had been invited, but they refused to come. It's so easy to become complacent and miss the opportunities that we are given today.

I'm thankful for a God that loves us enough to continue to invite us to his table, even if most of the time we don't have the good sense. To take him up on it. You've been listening to Everyday Miracles by Hope, mindfulness and Prayer.
