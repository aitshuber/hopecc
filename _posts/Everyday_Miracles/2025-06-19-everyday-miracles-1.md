I recently read this fascinating article about how different societies all over the world to pick Jesus to match their own image. Now we are all familiar with what I call California Jesus. With his blue eyes and blonde hair, but this is true all over the world. In Africa, you can find paintings of Mary making her pilgrimage to give birth to Jesus on a zebra.

How cool is that?

Now, of course, Jesus was only a Jew from the Middle East, but I find this totally interesting. That we change the face of Jesus to match our own.

The cynical read on this would be to assume that we are incapable of accepting a Jesus that looks different from us. I don't think that's true at all.

I think we do this. Because the love of Jesus is for everyone. It was never about where you come from.

The love of Jesus was always about the free gift of grace. There are no languages. Cultures or skin colors that love cannot cross.

Now, I don't see these different depictions of Jesus as a difference between us, but rather that we share in the same love of God and love for each other.

His love is for every nationality, and his grace is for every individual. The water of baptism is universal, and the love of Jesus is for everyone.

You've been listening to Everyday Miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
