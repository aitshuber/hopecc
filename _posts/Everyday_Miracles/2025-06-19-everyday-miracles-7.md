I was recently listening to the U2 album, all that you Can't Leave Behind, and I came across a song called Grace. The lyrics say this, grace takes the blame, covers the shame, removes the stain, but once was hurt, but once was friction. What left a mark? No longer stings because grace makes beauty out of ugly things.

That really spoke to me. I think back on all the things that I've done and all the horrible decisions that I've made, and if I'm being honest, the bad decisions I still make, I'm just so thankful. For the Gift of Grace, one of my favorite writers, b Brendan Manning, said that he progressed not by always making the right decision, but by responding appropriately to the wrong ones.

And I think that's all we can do. Learn where we can and continue moving forward. We take our mistakes, our hurts, and our hangups, and we try our best to transform them into something that God can use.

Paul says. This God saved you by His grace when you believed, and you can't take credit for that. It's a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for good things to me, grace is the singular. Achievement of the Christian faith. We are broken and undeserving, and yet Jesus says that God's love for you is unconditional and unending, and there is absolutely nothing that you can do to change that.

We can look back at our lives at all the things that we've done and despite those things. There is someone who sees you in perfect love today. I'm thankful for God's grace. I need it. It means forgiveness. It means second chances. It means that beauty can come from ugly things. You've been listening to Everyday Miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
