If you've ever gone through art history class, you're probably familiar with a painting called The Light of the World. It was painted by the British artist Holman Hunt, and hangs in St. Paul's Cathedral in London. It's one of the most iconic religious paintings in history. The painting depicts Jesus standing outside of a small, dilapidated cottage.

In one hand, he holds a lantern, and with the other, he's knocking at the door. But what's interesting about this painting is that there's no door handle on the outside of the door. For Jesus to enter the cottage, it has to be open from the inside. Holman's inspiration for the painting is a verse in Revelations, which says, I stand at the door and knock.

If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and we will share a meal together as friends, as such a simple verse. But when you see it personified in a painting, it totally changes your understanding of what it really means. Jesus won't force himself in, but he continues to stand outside and patiently waits to be invited in.

What an incredible gift. A friend who waits patiently for us, he knocks, but we don't answer, and yet he continues to wait patiently to share a meal together as friends. I pray that each day I have the good sense to open that door a little sooner and share my life with a creator who loves me.

You've been listening to Everyday Miracles, I hope, mindfulness and prayer.
