In the middle of the 19th century, an English traveler, Lord Marcus Sandy. Was served a sauce in a restaurant in Bombay, India. He got the recipe and took it back home to England to Liam Perens, the famous condiment makers to recreate it. They did their best, but when the Englishman tasted the sauce, he discovered that it was not as good as the sauce he had tasted in India.

Admitting defeat Lee and parens then banished the barrel of sauce to their basement and forgot about it. Two years later, someone found the sauce and tasted it. The flavor was incredible. Thyme had worked a miracle. That was the day that wishes her Soce was born. One of the hardest things in life is to wait.

It just doesn't feel fair. It feels like we should be able to get what we want and get it right now. But some of the best things in life and some of God's greatest gifts to us actually take time to develop. We simply aren't ready for them. Sometimes God has to prepare us for the things that he wants us to have.

The Apostle Paul says that patience is evidence of God's spirit in your life. The Book of Proverbs even says that it is better to be a patient person than to be a warrior. Patience isn't just waiting for what you want, it's accepting that not everything is meant for you. It's trusting that with time God is making something beautiful out of your life that could have never been made if you got exactly what you wanted.

Sometimes miracles, take time.

This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
