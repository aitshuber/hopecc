She was 19 months old when she had a fever that was so severe that it left her both blind and deaf. Helen Keller would grow up knowing nothing but silence and darkness. This made teaching Helen even the most basic things, almost impossible. Even given these circumstances, her parents were sure that she was intelligent, and when she was seven years old, her parents hired a tutor to help her learn to communicate.

Her name was Anne Sullivan. It took time, but Anne eventually taught Helen how to spell and how to communicate with the outside world. And after making so much. Progress. Anne believed it was time for Helen to hear about Jesus. So Anne called a friend, Philip Brooks, who had composed the Christmas Carol of a little town of Bethlehem to visit and tell Helen about Jesus.

So he went to visit Helen and with Anne translating, he told her all about Jesus and God. And when he finished a smile came to Helen's. Face. She responded by saying, Mr. Brooks, I have always known about God, but until now I didn't know his name.

The feeling of knowing that God is real has been a true feeling for me. As tough as life gets, sometimes there are these moments that just feel eternal. Like the supernatural ways of God intersect with my own life for just a second. And things make sense. Just brief moments where you know deep down in your heart that God is who he says he is and he's with you.

Helen Keller once said that she thinks God every day. That he has said in her darkness, the light of faith. I think that's true for all of us. This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
