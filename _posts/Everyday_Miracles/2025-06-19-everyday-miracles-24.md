Regardless of politics, Oliver Wendell Holmes is widely regarded as one of the most influential people to ever sit on the Supreme Court. Besides writing the decision for many landmark cases, he's also the oldest person to ever sit in the Supreme Court. He died at the age of 93, just two years after retiring from the court shortly after his inauguration.

President Roosevelt went to visit Oliver Holmes in his home for his 92nd birthday. President Roosevelt was surprised to find Judge Holmes reading Plato in his spare time. So he asked him, why do you read Plato Mr. Justice? Equally as surprised by the question, judge Holmes respond. To improve my mind, Mr.

President, a few months before his death, judge Holmes gave one final interview to a national newspaper in 1935. In the interview, he quoted his own translation of a poem. That was originally published 1500 years ago. Death Plucks my ears and says, live for, I'm coming. In the book of Ecclesiastes Solomon, who lived a life full of wealth and excess reflects on the meaning of life.

He begins by expressing a sentiment that most people will agree with, apart from God. Life is largely meaningless and it's unnecessarily hard. But in the end, Solomon has a word of wisdom for the living. There is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live, that everyone may eat and drink and find satisfaction in his toil, and that is the gift of God.

I find it striking that these men come to the same conclusion that life and death. Are two sides of the same coin. The meaning of life is simple, live because death is coming. That is the gift of God.

You've been listening to everyday Miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
