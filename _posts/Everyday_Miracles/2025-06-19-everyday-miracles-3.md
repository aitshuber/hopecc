This past Sunday, my church, my pastor, shared this funny story about a kid who was assigned the role of the Angel Gabriel in the annual church Christmas play. Now, this play is a big deal. People look forward to it all year long. They love it. This little boy had one line in the play that was it just this one line.

He had practiced this line over and over and over again with his mom. It is. I be not afraid. It is. I be not afraid. Finally, the big day had arrived. The church is decorated. Everyone's in their best Christmas outfits. It's a packed house. The place starts. Everything's going fine. This little boy walks on the stage to give his line and he totally freezes.

He doesn't remember his line. And his mom knew exactly what had happened the second he walked on stage. So she's on the side of the stage mouthing to him. It is. I be not afraid. It is. I. Be not afraid. Finally, the little boy stood up tall, prepared to say his line and he says, it's me, and I'm scared. That's it.

It's me and I'm scared. Totally whiffed it. God has one line wrong. Now, this could easily be the prayer for many of us. I know it is. For me, life is hard and it's scary not knowing where we're headed. But I think the words of the angel Gabriel still ring true. Being not afraid because God loves you and he's looking out for you.

This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer. I am just gonna let this music play. I'm enjoying it. This is fun. Thanks for tuning in. We'll see you guys next Sunday.
