Many years ago, the famous astronomer, Johannes Keebler, was concerned about a friend who denied the reality of God. His friend claimed that the world came into existence by itself. It just happened. The great astronomer decided on a project to make a point to his atheist friend. He constructed a large and elaborate model of the sun with the planet circling around it.

When his friend went into the observatory and saw this beautiful detailed model, he commented with joy. This is beautiful. Who made it? This must have been so difficult to make. Kepler casually answered. No one made it. It made itself. It all just came together. His friend looked at him and said, nonsense.

Tell me who made this. Kepler then answered my friend. You say that this little model could not make itself, but this is only a weak imitation of this great universe, which I understand you believe did make itself. Kepler had made an excellent point. I actually graduated from college with a degree in biology, and the more I study science, the more I see God.

I find him in the details of how a cell works, or in the fact that time is largely a construct. A perception based on our place in the galaxies. This world is a supernatural world of God's creation and we are just visitors living in it. Finding God in the wonder of nature is easy, but what I find totally amazing is that we can know this God the creator, has revealed himself to his creation 'cause he wants to be known, but not just by anyone.

He wants to be known by you. You are seen and you are loved by the creator of all things. The guy that was always there and will always be there loves you and sees you fully. This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
