One day while watching a baseball game, I once asked my grandfather who his all time favorite player was. I expected him to say someone from the Astros, 'cause they're basically our hometown team. But he said it was Hank Aaron. I asked him why. And what he said surprised me. Rather than cite his batting averages or his home run record, he told me a story.

Now, according to this story, Hank Aaron was checking into a hotel while on the road and after asking for a room, the young man at the front desk told him that the hotel was completely filled and they had no rooms available. Apparently a manager of the hotel was with an earshot and had recognized the Hall of Famer.

He immediately ran over and told the clerk, don't you know who this man is? This is the great Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves embarrassed. The front desk clerk immediately apologized and offered a room to Hank Aaron. Then he said, sir. Why didn't you tell me that you were somebody? And after a moment, Hank Aaron responded by saying, son, everybody is somebody.

Hank Aaron was a devout Christian until the day that he died. And in more ways than one, Hank Aaron's life reflected the example set by Jesus. It's one of the strongest messages that comes from the New Testament, everybody. Is somebody, the Apostle James said it like this, you must never treat people in different ways because of their outward appearance.

Today, I hope we all have the patience to remember that everybody is somebody and they are all loved by God. You've been listening to Everyday Miracles by Hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
