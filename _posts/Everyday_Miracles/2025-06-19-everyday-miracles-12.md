When I was in middle school, I used to love going over to my friend's house to spend the night. He had a big family with tons of brothers, and I was an only child, so I enjoyed the commotion of his house. Being that it was a large family, many times we got away with doing things we probably shouldn't have been doing.

On this one Friday night, we made the decision that we were gonna stay up really late until everyone went to sleep and watch a scary movie. I remember being in his living room and starting this movie around midnight. Well, around 30 minutes into the movie, I look over and my friend is completely asleep on the couch.

I am now alone watching this movie. And I was terrified and I don't think I slept the rest of the night.

Once I got home, I told my dad what had happened and while he was upset, at first, he mostly thought it was funny and I even convinced him to watch the movie with me. But this time I was prepared. I was wearing a sweatshirt with the hood all the way up. And I made a point to pick a chair with its back on the wall, but something funny happened when I watched the movie.

This time, I wasn't nearly as scared. Watching the movie with my dad had totally removed my fear. Watching it with him made me feel safe and looking back, this was a really special moment. Doesn't it feel like fear has a way of coming for each one of us? Maybe it's fear about losing your job or not making enough money.

One of the hardest truths in life is that if you're in a period of peace, appreciate it. 'cause hard times are on their way. Not exactly the fortune you want. In your fortune cookie, but true. But when you are in those times and you're afraid of the outcome, God has a message for you. In the book of Isaiah, he says this, fear not for I am with you.

Don't be afraid for I'm your God. I will strengthen you and help you.

When your father is there, you don't have to be scared 'cause you know you will always be taken care of.
