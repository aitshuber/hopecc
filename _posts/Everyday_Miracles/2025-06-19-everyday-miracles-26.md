I read a story a few months ago about what we searched for on Google. It was surprisingly interesting. It confirmed a lot of the things that I think we already know about ourselves. The scene, it quantified really puts a spotlight on the fact that we are lost and seeking meaning in our lives. It started by listing pretty innocuous things like searches for the Doctor peak around 8:20 AM and recipes for dinner peak around 4:52 PM where that weather, prayer, and new searches all peak at 5:30 AM There's even some funny searches like games that are not blocked at School Peak just after 8:00 AM.

But when the sun goes down, our searches take a different direction. Searches about suicide peak just after midnight. Questions about drugs, consciousness free will, and the meaning of life peak between two and 4:00 AM. The pain that these people have kept to themselves has finally come to the surface.

In the book of John, Jesus asked his disciples, what are you looking for? And what's strange is that his disciples don't even have a response. They evade his question. By asking Jesus where he plans to sleep that night. They can't tell Jesus what they're looking for. 'cause they don't know. I don't think much has changed since then.

Most of us don't know what we're looking for, but we can feel in our hearts that we are missing something essential.

Jesus eventually gave that answer. He said, I am the way. The truth and the life. Such a simple answer to a big question. All the love, acceptance, and peace you seek is available in him.

You've been listening to Everyday Miracles by Hope, mindfulness, and Prayer.
