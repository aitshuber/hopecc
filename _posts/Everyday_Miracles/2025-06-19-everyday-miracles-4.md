When I was a kid, I used to read these Batman comic books. I loved comic books. You know, one of the things about comic books is you get to the end of it and it's the pinnacle of the action, the pinnacle of the fight, and many times they end with to be continued and in some ways. It's a little disappointing.

You know, you don't get to know how it ends,

but in many ways it's exactly what you want from a comic book. You want the adventure to continue, the fight to continue, you know the story to continue.

Many years later, I went to the funeral of a friend's mother and someone at the funeral said to be continued. And I thought that was an interesting way of putting it.

You know, as Christians, we believe there's something waiting for us beyond death, something that we can look forward to. Perfect place. A place without pain and I think to be continued is a good way of putting that.

In Corinthians, Paul says, no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him. And today. I am thankful for the words to be continued. This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
