On January 12th, 1995, an 18 wheeler was on its way from Alberta, Canada to Yellowstone National Park. This truck was transporting eight wolves that would soon be relocated to the park. These would be the first wolves to live in Yellowstone since they had been hunted out of existence in the 1920s in the years since then.

The Yellowstone ecosystem had severely declined and the wolves were brought in to help manage an exploding elk population. Of course, this type of solution really bothered nearby residents and ranchers whose income was connected to the park. But something interesting happened. As the wolves began to hunt the elk, they left their grazing spots along the river to move back up the mountain where it was safer for them and because the land along the river wasn't being grazed, the trees and shrubberies grew back and strengthened the river bank.

And since the riverbank had been strengthened, the river began to flow more strongly. And since the river was flowing stronger, beavers came back and began to build dams, which attracted other small creatures. And once the bugs and small creatures had returned the birds. This one small change had a cascading effect that no one could have predicted from the outside.

Looking in, bringing wolves back in the Yellowstone was a bad idea. It was a threat to the order that they knew. But in actuality, the wolves restored the entire ecosystem and saved the park. In the book of Isaiah, they say this, I am the Lord and there is no other. I create the light. And make the darkness.

I send good times and bad times. In the book of Psalm, they say it like this, you can make many plans, but the Lord's purpose will prevail.

I had a friend recently ask me. Why I thought God a allowed bad things to happen. And the honest answer to that question is I don't know, but I do know that God sees the picture in a way I never will. I remind myself that when it feels like wolves have invaded my life, it may be God restoring my ecosystem.

You've been listening to Everyday Miracles by Hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
