John Wooden was perhaps the greatest basketball coach of all time. He was the head coach of UCLA and he won him 10 national championships in 12 years, and during that period, he even won 88 straight games. A few years ago, John Wooden was asked to give his opinion of the former Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight in a critical way.

Now if you don't know anything about Bobby Knight, he was equally as great as John Wooden, but much more volatile. Here's what Coach Wooden said of Bobby Knight. I believe Bob Knight to be an outstanding teacher of the game of basketball. I don't approve of his methods, but I'm not a judge and I'm not judging Bobby Knight.

There's so much bad in the best of us and so much good in the worst of us. It hardly behooves me to talk about the rest of us. In the book of Proverbs, they say it like this. Thoughtless words can wound as deeply as any sort, but wisely spoken words can heal. The Apostle James says these true words. If he does not control his tongue, his religion is worthless and he deceives himself self.

The words of Coach Wooden are true. There's so much bad in the best of us and so much good in the worst of us. It hardly behooves me to talk about the rest of us.

This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
