There's an old story about a young man in London back in the 18 hundreds who wanted to be a writer, but it was like the world was conspiring against him. He was in and outta school. His father had been thrown into jail 'cause he couldn't pay his debts. This young boy finally got a job pasting labels on the bottles of glue in a rat infested warehouse.

Every night, he slept in a small attic along with two other kids in the slums of London. He wanted to be a writer, but he had so little confidence in his ability to write that he had to sneak out in the middle of the night to mail his first manuscripts to a publisher. He didn't want anyone to know his dream so they wouldn't have the opportunity to laugh at him.

He submitted story after story, but they were all turned down by the editors. Finally, a day came that one of his stories was accepted. He wasn't paid anything for it, but this one editor had noticed him and praised his writing. He was so thrilled and excited that he walked around the streets of London with tears in his eyes.

That one positive word changed his entire life. That writer's name was Charles Dickens. It's amazing to me what a simple word of encouragement can do for someone. The Apostle Paul even says that it's our duty to encourage one another and build each other up. You don't have to be a millionaire. Or a philanthropist to change someone's life.

You have the power to change someone's entire world just by noticing them, by telling them that they're worthwhile and special. When you choose to see someone's gift, you're seeing them through God's eyes. This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
