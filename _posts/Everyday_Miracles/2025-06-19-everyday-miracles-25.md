Babe Ruth was perhaps the greatest baseball player of all time, but as he got older, babe Ruth had a tough time at the plate and he made lots of errors in the field. There's this great story about Babe Ruth during his last year of baseball. He had been traded by the Yankees and his new team, the Boston Braves were playing the Cincinnati Reds.

He got up to bat and he struck out. Babe Ruth wasn't the player he once had been. And as he walked back to the dugout, embarrassed and discouraged, some people in the stands started to boo him. There was a young boy sitting in the front row near the dugout who simply could not take it anymore. He loved Babe Ruth, no matter what.

So he jumped out of his seat, ran to Babe Ruth as he was walking into the dugout and threw his arms around him. Babe Ruth picked the boy up, gave him a big hug and put him back down on the ground. They walked hand in hand back to the dugout. A quietness came over the park. The crowd stopped booing as they remembered all the babe Ruth had done for the game of baseball.

And then they to their feet with cheers and applause. The boy chose to remember Babe Ruth at his best, rather than criticize him at his worst. In one Peter, it says, above all, love each other deeply. 'cause love covers over a multitude of sins. Today, I hope we remember that our words and actions have the incredible power to live someone's spirit.

This has been everyday miracles by hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
