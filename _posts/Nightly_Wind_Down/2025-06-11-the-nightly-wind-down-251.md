Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer,

I am the Lord and I do not change.

And again, I am the Lord and I do not change.

Now, take a moment to be grateful for this opportunity to relax.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There is nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts, don't force them back, be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice, Deep breaths

make them feel easy and effortless.

In through the nose, and out through the mouth,

feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale, feel how the body expands, then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air. As it travels in through the nose

and feel the body fall with each exhale,

with each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels.

Allow your breath to soften and release the tension in your body,

just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes itself.

Effortlessly rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. I am the Lord and I do not change.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
