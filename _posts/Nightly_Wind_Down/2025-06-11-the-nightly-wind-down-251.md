Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer. Be sure of this, I am with you always.

And again, be sure of this, I am with you always.

Now, bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale,

three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to ten and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way. It's okay.

There are no expectations.
