Begin by taking a few nice deep breaths,

and as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, and it is not proud. Love is not rude. It is not selfish. and it cannot be made angry easily.

And again, love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud. Love is not rude, it is not selfish, and it cannot be made angry easily.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you. In the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them.

Taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety,

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities, just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

Now take some nice deep breaths

in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Just watching the breath,

watching the rise and the fall of the chest.

Listening to the sounds of your breath,

notice your feelings. and emotions,

just taking note of them and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place where you feel loved.

Feel that sense of natural peace. That can only be found in God's presence.

Remember, when you come near to God, He will come near to you.

Take this verse with you. Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous. It does not brag, and it is not proud. Love is not rude. It is not selfish. And it cannot be made angry easily.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
