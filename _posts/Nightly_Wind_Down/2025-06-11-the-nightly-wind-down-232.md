Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

Calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. All at once, you turned on a floodlight for me. You are the revelation light in my darkness. In your brightness, I can see the path ahead.

And again, all at once you turned on a floodlight for me. You are the revelation light in my darkness. And in your brightness, I can see the path ahead.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

taking some nice, slow, deep, full Breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest. Rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Take a few nice big, deep breaths in.

Allow your body. and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There is nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away. And that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing.

Effortlessly, rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. All at once you turned on a floodlight for me. You are the revelation light in my darkness, and in your brightness I can see the path ahead.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
