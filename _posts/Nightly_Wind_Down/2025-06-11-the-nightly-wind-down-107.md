Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest.

And when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

I will live in them and walk among them. I will be their God and they will be my people.

And again, I will live in them. and walk among them. I will be their God and they will be my people.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, easy focus.

begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils and into the chest. and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note of the and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel loved. a sense of security in him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, That's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety,

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities, just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

Allow your awareness to rest. Eee. Oh, yeah, Yeah. I have. Speaking of cleansing, at the center of Zeus's body is his fight with Athena. They were worried how well she was going to fight and therefor could not play her, her Athena is showcasing us that she is real, that she made a promise, and that she will And her promise, a promise is a ministry, she will ask us for aspersions to help her be in order, that's the promise, the honest witness.

Oh, my. If you do not follow one another independently, you will not film yourself on a moon, it is going to see very bad and it will be difficult to make a satellite sometime down the hill
