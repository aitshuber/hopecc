Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer. There is no power that could ever be found in the universe that can distance us from God's passionate love.

There is no power that could ever be found in the universe that can distance us from God's passionate love.

Now, take a moment to be grateful for this opportunity to relax.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There is nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away. And that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing

in through the nose and out through the mouth,

just watching the breath,

watching the rise and the fall of the chest,

listening to the sounds. of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions,

just taking note of them, and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place Where you feel loved,

feel that sense of natural peace that can only be found in God's presence.

Remember, when you come near to God, He will come near to you.

Take this verse with you.

There is no power that could ever be found in the universe that can distance us from God's passionate love.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
