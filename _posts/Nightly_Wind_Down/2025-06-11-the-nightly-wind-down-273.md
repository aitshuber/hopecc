Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

Calmly, bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

And again. I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd. lays down his life for the sheep.

Now bring your attention to the way the body feels.

Notice your breath.

Allow the inhales to expand the body.

Notice how the exhales make you feel.

Feel the body relax and become heavier.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Soften the forehead. down the front of the face.

Allow the neck to relax and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the temples.

Feel the weight of the body so the arms become heavy.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the bones become heavy,

letting the breath become natural.

Allow the whole body to soften and release.

Notice how good it feels. Just to breathe,

allow your breath to make the body feel heavy. The

body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

And 2 on the exhale.

3 on the next inhale.

And 4 on the next exhale.

Counting up to 10 and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from 1.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale. Allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you.

I am the Good Shepherd. The Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
