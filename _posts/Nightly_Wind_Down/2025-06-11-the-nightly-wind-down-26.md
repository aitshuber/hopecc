Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self discipline.

And again. For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self discipline.

Gently bring your awareness to the feeling of the body,

just noticing any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin,

or the weight of the body. in the bed.

Follow your breath and notice how it changes the body.

The inhales, expanding the body,

and the exhales, relaxing the body.

Follow it as it comes in through the nose and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance.

Try not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace that's already present in your heart.

Let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love and deep rest. Allow your mind to find refuge in God.

Gently bring the awareness to the breath.

Allow your breath to deepen and fill the lungs.

Take a nice, big, deep breath in. Now slow down on the exhale, letting go.

Let the inhale come easily and effortlessly,

and exhale, controlling the breath, slowing it down.

Give yourself some space just to be.

Whatever you need to let go of, let it go. Release it to God. Allow this time to be what you need it to be.

And if the thoughts take you away, know that that's okay. When it feels natural and effortless, slowly bring your attention back to the breath.

Remember, this is a place of safety.

God's calming presence is always accessible to you.

Release your anxieties and let God handle what you cannot.

Notice how the body is relaxing and releasing.

Now, begin to soften the back of your neck.

Allow your limbs to become heavy.

Allow the shoulders to relax.

Let your mind rest.

Take this verse with you, for God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity. But of power, love, and self discipline.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
