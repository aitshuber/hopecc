Begin by taking a few nice deep breaths,

and as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.

Again. Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room. With a nice, easy focus,

begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils and into the chest. and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination.

Bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders,

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands Relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs, the knees.

Relax the calves down to the ankles.

Bring your attention back to the breath,

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale.

Take this verse with you. Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
