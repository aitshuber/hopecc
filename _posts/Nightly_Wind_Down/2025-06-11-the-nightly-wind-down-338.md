Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close, like the sun sets.

Calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

God sent his son into the world. He did not send him to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him.

And again. God sent his son into the world. He did not send him to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him.

Now bring your attention to the way the body feels.

Notice your breath.

Allow the inhales to expand the body.

Notice how the exhales make you feel.

Feel the body relax. and become heavier.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Soften the forehead down the front of the face.

Allow the neck to relax and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the temples.

Feel the weight of the body. So the arms become heavy.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the bones. become heavy,

letting the breath become natural.

Allow the whole body to soften and release.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy. The

body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One, on the inhale.

and two on the exhale,

three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay, just start over again. counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath. On

the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. God sent his son into the world. He did not send him to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax. and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.

Calmly, bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

And again, I can do all things through Christ. who strengthens me.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm Beneath those emotions,

maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax. Notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety,

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There is nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away, and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing.

Effortlessly rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

And again, I will be your father. You will be my sons and daughters.

Now, take some nice, deep breaths.

In through the nose and out through the mouth.

Just watching the breath.

Watching the rise and the fall of the chest.

Listening to the sounds of your breath.

Notice your feelings. and emotions,

just taking note of them and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place where you feel loved.

Feel that sense of natural peace. that can only be found in God's presence.

Bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, Easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils, and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest. With the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. I will be your father and you will be my sons and daughters.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
