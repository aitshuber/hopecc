Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.

And again, be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.

Gently. Bring your awareness to the feeling of the body,

just noticing any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin

or the weight of the body in the bed.

Follow your breath and notice how it changes the body.

The inhales expanding the body and

the exhales relaxing the body.

Follow it as it comes in through the nose. and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance. Try

not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace. that's already present in your heart.

Let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love and deep rest. Allow your mind to find refuge in God.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension. in the hands.

Let the palms open. Relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go. Allow

the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax.

Almost like they're melting.

If you need a deep breath, take it. Keep it easy and natural.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go. Nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings. that you're having in the body,

not judging, just noticing.

Allow yourself to release those feelings of tightness and tension.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus.

Just allow yourself to be.

Take this verse with you. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
