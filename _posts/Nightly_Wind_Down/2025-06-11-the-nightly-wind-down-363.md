Let's begin by consciously turning off the body.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close. Like the sun sets,

calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

the palms open and relax each finger.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale,

three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to ten and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath

on the next exhale, Allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.
