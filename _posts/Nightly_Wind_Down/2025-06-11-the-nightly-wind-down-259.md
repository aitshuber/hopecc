Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer. Let my passion for life be restored, tasting joy in every breakthrough you bring to me.

And again. Let my passion for life be restored, tasting joy in every breakthrough you bring to me.

Now, take a moment to be grateful for this opportunity to relax.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly. with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body Relax a little more into your bed,

and on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale,

three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again. counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath. Next

exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. Let my passion for life be restored, tasting joy in every breakthrough you bring to me.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax. and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
