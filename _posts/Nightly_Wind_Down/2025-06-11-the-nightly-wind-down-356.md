Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

We are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God's perfect plan.

And again. We are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God's perfect plan.

When it feels natural, begin releasing the tension in your hands, shoulders, and neck.

Let go of that stress.

Release your anxieties and worries to God.

Let go of your grip on control.

Take a big, deep breath in.

Release your stress.

Let go of your frustrations.

Let it all go on the exhale.

We aren't holding on to the thoughts. We're just letting them release.

Now bring your awareness to the way the body feels.

Allow yourself to sink into your chair or your bed.

Let the body relax and release.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention to the heart.

Feel the heartbeat,

just noticing it.

Allow that natural rhythm and stillness to relax the body.

Just notice the way that you feel,

not trying to change it. Just accepting it the way that it is.

Gently bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Just noticing any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin

or the weight of the body in the bed.

Follow your breath and notice how it changes the body. The

inhales expanding the body and

the exhales relaxing the body.

Follow it. as it comes in through the nose and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance.

Try not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace that's already present in your heart.

Let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love and deep rest. Allow your mind to find refuge in God.

Take this verse with you. We are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together. to fit into God's perfect plan.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
