Let's start by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Love is a safe place of shelter, for it never stops believing the best for others.

And again, love is a safe place of shelter, for it never stops believing the best for others.

Now, slowly begin to relax and allow the body to open.

Consciously, start to relax and turn off the muscles.

Start with the muscles in the feet. Allow the feet to turn out and relax at the ankles,

letting the hips soften.

The knees are relaxing.

The stomach begins to let go,

softening the shoulders,

allowing the head to relax and become heavy at the neck. Allow

the chest and back to open.

Allow the body to settle.

Just noticing how the body feels.

Feeling the gravity of the body and how it pushes you down into the bed.

And when it feels comfortable, allow your awareness to rest.

If the mind wants to think, then let it think. If it wants to be still, allow it to be still.

Gently bring the awareness to the breath.

Allow your breath to deepen and fill the lungs.

Take a nice, big, deep breath in. Now slow down on the exhale, letting go.

Let the inhale come easily. and effortlessly.

And exhale, controlling the breath, slowing it down.

Give yourself some space just to be.

Whatever you need to let go of, let it go. Release it to God. Allow this time to be what you need it to be.

And if the thoughts take you away, know that that's okay. When it feels natural and effortless, slowly bring your attention back to the breath.

Remember, this is a place of safety.

God's calming presence is always accessible to you.

Release your anxieties and let God handle what you cannot.

Notice how the body is relaxing. and releasing.

Let your mind rest,

just noticing and appreciating this moment.

Take this verse with you. Love is a safe place of shelter, for it never stops believing the best for others.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go. In your presence, I trust your plan for my life.


Begin by getting comfortable and allowing your body to relax.

As you begin to feel your body releasing, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

The Word gave life to everything that was created, and His life brought light to everyone.

And again. The word gave life to everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone.

Gently bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Just noticing any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin,

or the weight of the body in the bed.

Follow your breath. And notice how it changes the body.

The inhales expanding the body,

and the exhales relaxing the body.

Follow it as it comes in through the nose and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm. that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance.

Try not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace that's already present in your heart.

Let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love and deep rest. Allow your mind to find refuge in God.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax. and the joints. Release

the shoulders, falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go. Allow

the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax.

Almost like they're melting.

If you need a deep breath, take it. Keep it easy and natural.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Allow yourself. to release those feelings of tightness and tension.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus.

Just allow yourself to be.

Take this verse with you. The Word gave life to everything that was created, and his life brought light to everyone.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

And again, come to me, all you who are weary and burdened. and burdened, and I will give you rest.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, Allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice Easy focus.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you. And he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
