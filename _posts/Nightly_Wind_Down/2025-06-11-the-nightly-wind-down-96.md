Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer.

Jesus said to his disciples, Don't be worried, have faith in God and have faith in me.

And again, Jesus said to his disciples, Don't be worried. Have faith in God and have faith in me.

Gently bring the awareness to the breath.

Allow your breath to deepen and fill the lungs.

Take a nice, big, deep breath in. Now slow down on the exhale, letting go.

Let the inhale come easily and effortlessly.

and exhale, controlling the breath, slowing it down.

Give yourself some space just to be.

Whatever you need to let go of, let it go. Release it to God. Allow this time to be what you need it to be.

And if the thoughts take you away, know that that's okay, when it feels natural. and effortless. Slowly bring your attention back to the breath.

Remember, this is a place of safety.

God's calming presence is always accessible to you.

Release your anxieties and let God handle what you cannot.

Notice how the body is relaxing and releasing.

Now, begin to soften the back of your neck.

Allow your limbs to become heavy.

Allow the shoulders to relax.

Let your mind rest.

Now, slowly begin to relax and allow the body to open

consciously. Start to relax and turn off the muscles.

Start with the muscles in the feet. Allow the feet to turn out and relax at the ankles,

letting the hips soften.

The knees are relaxing.

The stomach begins to let go,

softening the shoulders.

Allowing the head to relax and become heavy at the neck.

Allow the chest and back to open.

Allow the body to settle.

Just noticing how the body feels.

Feeling the gravity of the body and how it pushes you down. into the bed,

and when it feels comfortable, allow your awareness to rest.

If the mind wants to think, then let it think. If it wants to be still, allow it to be still.

Take this verse with you. Jesus said to his disciples, Don't be worried. Have faith in God, and have faith in me,

God. I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
