Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer.

Don't worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank Him for all He has done.

And again. Don't worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done.

Now, slowly begin to relax and allow the body to open.

Consciously, start to relax and turn off the muscles.

Start with the muscles in the feet. Allow the feet to turn out and relax at the ankles.

Letting the hips soften.

The knees are relaxing.

The stomach begins to let go,

softening the shoulders.

Allowing the head to relax and become heavy at the neck. Allow

the chest and back to open.

Allow the body. to settle.

Just noticing how the body feels,

feeling the gravity of the body and how it pushes you down into the bed.

And when it feels comfortable, allow your awareness to rest.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy. and effortless.

In through the nose and out through the mouth.

Feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale, feel how the body expands. Then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air. as it travels in through the nose

and feel the body fall. With each exhale,

with each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels.

Allow your breath to soften and release the tension. in your body

just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes itself.

Take this verse with you. Don't worry about anything. Instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need and thank him for all he has done.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax. and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
