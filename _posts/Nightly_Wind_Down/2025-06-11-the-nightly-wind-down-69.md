Begin by taking a few nice, deep breaths.

And as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone. A new life has begun.

And again. This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone, a new life has begun.

Bring your attention to the way the breath feels.

Let it settle into a natural rhythm,

effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels to just breathe.

With each exhale, let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release and unlock.

Gently bring your attention to your feelings or emotions,

just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today.

Not engaging with those emotions, Remembering that we can leave those feelings right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts, and then let them be.

Rest into that deeper sense of calm. can only be found in God's love.

You're inviting God to bring calm over your body, to bring peace into your spirit,

resting into your true nature, a child of God.

Now, slowly begin to relax and allow the body to open.

Consciously. Start to relax and turn off the muscles.

Start with the muscles in the feet. Allow the feet to turn out and relax at the ankles,

letting the hips soften.

The knees are relaxing. The

stomach begins to let go,

softening the shoulders.

Allowing the head to relax and become heavy at the neck,

the chest and back to open.

Allow the body to settle.

Just noticing how the body feels.

Feeling the gravity of the body and how it pushes you down into the bed.

And when it feels comfortable, allow your awareness to rest.

If the mind wants to think, then let it think. If it wants to be still, allow it to be still.

Take this verse with you. This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone. A new life has begun.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax. and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
