Begin by getting comfortable, and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to relax, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

And again. For I know the plans I have for you. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you hope and a future.

Now bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless

in through the nose. and out through the mouth,

feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale, feel how the body expands, then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose,

and feel the body fall with each exhale,

with each breath. Allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels.

Allow your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes. itself.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body.

Not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them.

Taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

Begin to notice how your body feels. Consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety.

Surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take this verse with you. For I know the plans I have for you. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you hope and a future.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer. I drew a picture of you on my hand. You are always before my eyes.

Again, I drew a picture of you on my hand. You are always before my eyes.

Now, take some nice, deep breaths,

in through the nose and out through the mouth,

just watching the breath,

watching the rise and the fall of the chest.

listening to the sounds of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions,

just taking note of them and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place where you feel loved.

Feel that sense of natural peace that can only be found in God's presence.

Remember, when you come near to God, He will come near to you.

Now, take a moment to be grateful for this opportunity to relax,

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Take a few nice, big breaths in.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There's nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away. And that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing.

Take this verse with you. I drew a picture of you on my hand. You are always before my eyes.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
