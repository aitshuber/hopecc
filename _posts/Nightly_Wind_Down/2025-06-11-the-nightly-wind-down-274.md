Begin by getting comfortable, and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to relax, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Now I can say to myself, relax and rest, for the Lord rewards fully those who simply trust in Him.

And again. Now I can say to myself, relax and rest, for the Lord rewards fully those who simply trust in Him.

With an easy awareness, begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening and enjoying the sounds, not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness back to the body. Noticing the weight of the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress. Being mindful to stay present in this moment.

Let yourself unwind and naturally relax in the presence of God.

As your awareness begins to drift deeper, rest into the calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God.

Bring your attention to the way the breath feels.

Let it settle into a natural rhythm,

effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels to just breathe.

With each exhale. Let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release and unlock.

Feel the effects of gravity on the body.

Now, gently bring your attention to your feelings or emotions.

Just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today.

Not engaging with those emotions. Remembering. that we can leave those feelings right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts, and then let them be.

Rest into that deeper sense of calm that can only be found in God's love.

You're inviting God to bring calm over your body, to bring peace into your spirit,

resting into your true nature, a child of God.

Take this verse with you.

Now I can say to myself, relax and rest, for the Lord rewards fully Those who simply trust in Him.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Begin by getting comfortable, and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to relax, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will neither fail you. nor abandon you.

And again, do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body.

Not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them.

Taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe. a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness. back to this place of love and safety.

Surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension, in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release,

the shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs,

relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

If you need a deep breath, take it. Keep it easy and natural.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Allow yourself to release those feelings of tightness and tension.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus.

Just allow yourself to be.

Take this verse with you. Do not be afraid. Or discouraged for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

This is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you. is with you wherever you go.

And again, this is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord, your God, is with you wherever you go.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension. in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy,

allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be, you are here,

everything is perfectly how it should be.

That's your mind. Relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Now bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more. into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale.

Three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale.

Counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. This is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord, your God, is with you wherever you go.

God bless. I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
