Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer. Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God. I will praise Him again, my Savior and my God.

And again. Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God. I will praise Him again, my Savior and my God.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax. With each exhale,

feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face,

just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, Easy focus.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you, and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Why am I discouraged? Why is my heart so sad? I will put my hope in God. I will praise him again, my Savior and my God.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
