Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close. Like the sun sets,

calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. He will once again fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.

Again, he will once again fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in. and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body. in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm.

Notice how good it feels. Just to be here, in this moment.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There's nowhere to go. There's nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax. and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing

effortlessly. Rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. He will once again fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
