Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

And again. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils. and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

When it feels natural, begin releasing the tension in your hands. shoulders and neck.

Let go of that stress.

Release your anxieties and worries to God.

Let go of your grip on control.

Take a big deep Breath in,

release your stress.

Let go of your frustrations.

Let it all go on the exhale.

We aren't holding on to the thoughts. We're just letting them release.

Now bring your awareness to the way the body feels.

Allow yourself to sink into your chair or your bed.

Let the body relax and release.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention To the heart.

Feel the heartbeat.

Just noticing it.

Allow that natural rhythm and stillness to relax the body.

Just notice the way that you feel.

Not trying to change it. Just accepting it the way that it is.

Take this verse with you. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him God,

I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
