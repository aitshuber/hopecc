Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.

And again. The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.

Bring your attention to the way the breath feels.

Let it settle into a natural rhythm,

effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels to just breathe.

With each exhale, Let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release and unlock.

Gently bring your attention to your feelings or emotions.

Just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today.

Not engaging with those emotions. Remembering that we can leave those feelings right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts, and then let them be.

Rest into that deeper sense of calm that can only be found in God's love.

resting into your true nature, a child of God.

Now, slowly begin to relax and allow the body to open.

Start with the muscles in the feet. Allow the feet to turn out and relax at the ankles, letting

the hips soften.

The knees are relaxing.

The stomach begins to let go,

softening the shoulders,

allowing the head to relax and become heavy at the neck. Allow

the chest and back to open.

Allow the body to relax. to settle.

Just noticing how the body feels,

feeling the gravity of the body and how it pushes you down into the bed.

And when it feels comfortable, allow your awareness to rest.

Take this verse with you.

The Lord is compassionate, Gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
