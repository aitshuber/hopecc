Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted. He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.

And again, the Lord is close to the brokenhearted. He rescues those whose spirits are crushed

when it feels natural. Begin releasing the tension in your hands, shoulders, and neck.

Let go of that stress.

Release your anxieties and worries to God.

Let go of your grip on control.

Take a big, deep breath in.

Release your stress.

Let go of your frustrations.

Let it all go on the exhale.

We aren't holding on to the thoughts. We're just letting them release.

Now bring your awareness. to the way the body feels.

Allow yourself to sink into your chair or your bed.

Let the body relax and release.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention to the heart.

Feel the heartbeat,

just noticing it.

Allow that natural rhythm and stillness to relax the body.

Just notice the way that you feel,

not trying to change it, just accepting it the way that it is.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room. With a nice, easy focus,

begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils, and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

Take this verse with you.

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted. He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Let's start by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. Lord, You know everything there is to know about me.

And again, Lord, You know everything there is to know about me.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless,

in through the nose and out through the mouth,

feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale. Feel how the body expands. Then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose

and feel the body fall. With each exhale,

with each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels.

Allow your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes itself

with an easy awareness. Begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening and enjoying the sounds, not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness back to the body. Noticing the weight of the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress. Being mindful to stay present in this moment.

Let yourself unwind. And naturally relax in the presence of God.

As your awareness begins to drift deeper, rest into the calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God.

Take this verse with you. Lord, you know everything there is to know about me.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
