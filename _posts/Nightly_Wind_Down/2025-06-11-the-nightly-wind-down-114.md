Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest.

And when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Keep company with me, and you'll learn to live freely and lightly.

And again, keep company with me. and you'll learn to live freely and lightly.

Gently bring the awareness to the breath.

Allow your breath to deepen and fill the lungs.

Take a nice, big, deep breath in. Now slow down on the exhale, letting go.

Let the inhale come easily and effortlessly,

and exhale. Controlling the breath, slowing it down.

Give yourself some space just to be.

Whatever you need to let go of, let it go. Release it to God. Allow this time to be what you need it to be.

And if the thoughts take you away, know that that's okay. When it feels natural and effortless, Slowly bring your attention back to the breath.

Remember, this is a place of safety.

God's calming presence is always accessible to you.

Release your anxieties, and let God handle what you cannot.

Notice how the body is relaxing and releasing.

Now, begin to soften the back of your neck.

Allow your limbs to become heavy.

Allow the shoulders To relax,

let your mind rest.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds. in the room with a nice, easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils and into the chest. and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination.

Allow your awareness to rest. With the presence of God,

take this verse with you, keep company with me, and you'll learn to live freely and lightly.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
