Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer. Your word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path.

And again, your word is a lamp. to guide my feet and a light for my path.

When it feels natural, begin releasing the tension in your hands, shoulders, and neck.

Let go of that stress.

Release your anxieties and worries to God.

Let go of your grip on control.

Take a big, deep breath in.

Release your stress.

Let go of your frustrations.

Let it all go on the exhale.

We aren't holding on to the thoughts. We're just letting them release.

Now bring your awareness to the way the body feels.

Allow yourself to sink. into your chair or your bed.

Let the body relax and release.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention to the heart.

Feel the heartbeat,

just noticing it.

Allow that natural rhythm and stillness to relax the body.

Just notice the way that you feel,

not trying to change it. Just accepting it the way that it is.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice Easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils, and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest. With the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Your Word is a lamp to guide my feet and a light for my path.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer.

We know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God.

We know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God.

With an easy awareness, begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening and enjoying the sounds, not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness. Back to the body. Noticing the weight of the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress. Being mindful to stay present in this moment.

Let yourself unwind and naturally relax in the presence of God.

Now, bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice deep breaths. Deep breaths.

Allow your breathing to relax the mind.

Feel the body become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm. Begin to notice

the sounds in the room.

Not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, remember that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

As your awareness begins to drift deeper, rest into the calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God.

Take this verse with you.

We know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
