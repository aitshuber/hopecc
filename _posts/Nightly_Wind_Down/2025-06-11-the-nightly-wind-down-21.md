Begin by getting comfortable and allowing your body to relax.

As you begin to feel your body releasing, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

The Lord is my strength and shield. I trust him with all my heart. And again. The Lord is my strength and shield.

I trust him with all my heart.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done, is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice, deep breaths.

Allow your breathing to relax the mind.

Feel the body become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room,

not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, remember, that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the sounds.

Now bring your attention. to the way the body feels.

Notice your breath.

Allow the inhales to expand the body.

Notice how the exhales make you feel.

Feel the body relax and become heavier.

Now, soften the forehead down the front of the face.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Allow the neck to relax and the shoulders to fall away. from the ears.

Relax the temples.

Feel the weight of the body so the arms become heavy.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the bones become heavy.

Allow the whole body to soften and release.

Now give yourself a moment to relax and totally let go.

Take this verse with you. The Lord is my strength and shield. I trust him with all my heart.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

This is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you. is with you wherever you go.

And again, this is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord, your God, is with you wherever you go.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension. in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy,

allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be, you are here,

everything is perfectly how it should be.

That's your mind. Relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Now bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more. into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale.

Three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale.

Counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. This is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord, your God, is with you wherever you go.

God bless. I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
