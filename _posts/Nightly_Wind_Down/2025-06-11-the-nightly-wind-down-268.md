Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer.

Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full.

And again, Give and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full.

Now, slowly begin to relax and allow the body to open.

Consciously, start to relax and turn off the muscles.

Start with the muscles in the feet. Allow the feet to turn out and relax at the ankles,

letting the hips soften.

The knees are relaxing.

The stomach begins to let go,

softening the shoulders,

allowing the head to relax and become heavy at the neck.

Allow the chest and back.

Allow the body to settle,

just noticing how the body feels,

feeling the gravity of the body and how it pushes you down into the bed.

And when it feels comfortable, allow your awareness to rest. If

the mind wants to think, then let it think. If it wants to be still, allow it to be still.

Bring your attention. to the way the breath feels.

Let it settle into a natural rhythm,

effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels to just breathe.

With each exhale, let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release. and unlock.

Feel the effects of gravity on the body, letting gravity pull the body down into the bed or the chair.

Now, gently bring your attention to your feelings or emotions,

just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today,

not engaging with those emotions, remembering that we can leave those feelings. right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts and then let them be.

Rest into that deeper sense of calm that can only be found in God's love.

You're inviting God to bring calm over your body, to bring peace into your spirit,

resting into your true nature, a child of God.

Take this verse with you.

Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
