Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

Love is kind and patient, never jealous, boastful, proud, or rude. Love isn't selfish or quick tempered.

And again. Love is kind and patient, never jealous, boastful, proud, or rude. Love isn't selfish or quick tempered.

Now bring your attention to the breath, taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, easy focus.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal, there's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Love is kind and patient, never jealous, boastful, proud, or rude. Love isn't selfish or quick tempered.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax. and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
