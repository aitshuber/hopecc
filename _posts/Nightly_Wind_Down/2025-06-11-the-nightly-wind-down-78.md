Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest,

and when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Love never comes to an end.

Again, love never comes to an end.

Bring your attention. to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders.

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs. The knees,

relax the calves, down to the ankles.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale,

taking some nice Slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly. exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale. Feel

the weight of the body. in the bed or the chair.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face,

just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Take this verse with you. Love never comes to an end.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer. Your promise revives me. It comforts me in all my troubles.

And again. Your promise revives me. It comforts me. in all my troubles.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release,

the shoulders falling away from the ears,

feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs,

relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy,

allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

If you need a deep breath, take it, keep it easy and natural.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Gently bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Just noticing. any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin

or the weight of the body in the bed.

Follow your breath and notice how it changes the body.

The inhales expanding the body and

the exhales relaxing the body.

Follow it as it comes in through the nose and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance.

Try not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace that's already present. In your heart,

let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love and deep rest. Allow your mind to find refuge in God.

Take this verse with you. Your promise revives me. It comforts me in all my troubles.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
