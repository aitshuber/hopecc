Let it settle into a natural rhythm.

Effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels to just breathe.

With each exhale, let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release And unlock,

feel the effects of gravity on the body, letting gravity pull the body down into the bed or the chair.

just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today,

not engaging with those emotions, remembering. We can leave those feelings right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts, and then let them be.

Begin to feel the space around the body.
