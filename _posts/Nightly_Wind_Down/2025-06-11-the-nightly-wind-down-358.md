And again, I can do all things through Christ. who strengthens me.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm Beneath those emotions,

maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax. Notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety,

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.
