Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer. If you forgive those who sin against you, your Heavenly Father will forgive you.

And again, if you forgive those who sin against you. Your Heavenly Father will forgive you.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open, relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders relax. Falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax.

Almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go. Nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Now bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels. Just to breathe,

allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

The body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

And two on the exhale,

three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to ten and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be, we're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale. Allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. If you forgive those who sin against you, your Heavenly Father will forgive you.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
