Let's go ahead and get comfortable in your bed or in your chair,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

And again, come to me, all you who are weary and burdened. and burdened, and I will give you rest.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, Allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice Easy focus.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you. And he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life. 


Begin by taking a few nice deep breaths,

and as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.

Again. Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room. With a nice, easy focus,

begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils and into the chest. and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination.

Bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders,

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands Relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs, the knees.

Relax the calves down to the ankles.

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale.

Take this verse with you. Love never gives up on people. It never stops trusting, never loses hope, and never quits.

I will sing out in thanks to the Lord. Praise Him, for He has delivered me.

And again, I will sing out in thanks to the Lord. Praise Him, for He has delivered me.
