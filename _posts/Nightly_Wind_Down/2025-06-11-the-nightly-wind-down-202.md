Begin by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. Those who find me, find life, and the Lord will be pleased with them.

And again, those who find me, find life. and the Lord will be pleased with them.

Now, take some nice, deep breaths,

in through the nose and out through the mouth,

just watching the breath,

watching the rise and the fall of the chest,

listening to the sounds of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions,

just taking note of them. and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place where you feel loved.

Feel that sense of natural peace. that can only be found in God's presence.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Take this verse with you. Those who find me find life, and the Lord will be pleased with them.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest,

and when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

The Lord is close to the brokenhearted. He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.

And again, The Lord is close. to the brokenhearted. He rescues those whose spirits are crushed.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax. And the joints release,

the shoulders falling away from the ears,

feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs,

relaxing and letting go,

allow the legs to be heavy,

allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Allow yourself to release. Those feelings of tightness and tension.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus.

Just allow yourself to be.

Now take some nice, deep breaths.

In through the nose and out through the mouth.

Just watching the breath.

Watching the rise and the fall of the chest. Just

listening to the sounds. of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions,

just taking note of them, and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place where you feel loved.

Feel that sense of natural peace that can only be found in God's presence.

Remember, when you come near to God, He will come near to you.

Take this verse with you. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted. He rescues Those whose spirits are crushed.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

This is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you. is with you wherever you go.

And again, this is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord, your God, is with you wherever you go.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension. in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy,

allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be, you are here,

everything is perfectly how it should be.

That's your mind. Relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Now bring your attention to your breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more. into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale.

Three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale.

Counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. This is my command. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord, your God, is with you wherever you go.

God bless. I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
