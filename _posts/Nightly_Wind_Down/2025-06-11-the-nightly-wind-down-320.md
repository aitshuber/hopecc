Begin by taking a few nice, deep breaths.

And as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Because you belong to Christ Jesus, God's peace will stand guard over all your thoughts and feelings.

And again. Because you belong to Christ Jesus, God's peace will stand guard over all your thoughts and feelings.

Now, take some nice, deep breaths,

in through the nose, and out through the mouth,

just watching the breath,

watching the rise and the fall of the chest.

listening to the sounds of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions,

just taking note of them and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place. where you feel loved.

Feel that sense of natural peace that can only be found in God's presence.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

taking some nice, slow, deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and expand and slowly. exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to relax. to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now let go of the breath, let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Take this verse with you. Because you belong to Christ Jesus, God's peace will stand guard over all your thoughts and feelings.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
