Let's start by taking a few nice, deep breaths.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, Whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.

And again, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable, if anything is excellent or praiseworthy, think about such things.

Now bring your attention to the way the body feels.

Notice your breath.

Allow the inhales to expand the body.

Notice how the exhales make you feel.

Feel the body relax and become heavier.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Soften the forehead, down the front of the face.

Allow the neck to relax and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the temples.

Feel the weight of the body so the arms become heavy.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the bones become heavy.

Letting the breath become natural,

allow the whole body to soften and release.

Gently bring the awareness to the breath.

Allow your breath to deepen and fill the lungs.

Take a nice, big, deep breath in. Now slow down on the exhale, letting go.

Let the inhale come easily. and effortlessly.

And exhale, controlling the breath, slowing it down.

Give yourself some space just to be.

Whatever you need to let go of, let it go. Release it to God. Allow this time to be what you need it to be.

And if the thoughts take you away, know that that's okay. When it feels natural and effortless, slowly bring your attention back to the breath.

Remember, this is a place of safety.

God's calming presence is always accessible to you.

Release your anxieties. and let God handle what you cannot.

just noticing. Any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin

or the weight of the body in the bed.
