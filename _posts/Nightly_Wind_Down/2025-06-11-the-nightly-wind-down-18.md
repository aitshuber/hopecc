Go ahead and get comfortable in your position,

really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your mind rest with this verse and prayer.

Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life.

And again, Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life.

Now let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release.

The shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go. Allow

the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax.

Almost like they're melting.

If you need a deep breath, take it. Keep it easy and natural.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go. Nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Gently bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Just noticing any sensations in the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin,

or the weight of the body in the bed.

Follow your breath and notice how it changes the body.

The inhales expanding the body and

the exhales relaxing the body.

Follow it as it comes in through the nose and goes back out through the mouth.

It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You're simply unearthing the calm. that was already there.

Begin to feel the space around the body.

Notice it with a subtle sense of gratitude and acceptance.

Try not to resist anything. You're just revealing the peace that's already present in your heart.

Let go of your worries. This is a safe place of love. And deep rest, allow your mind to find refuge in God.

Take this verse with you. Jesus said, I am the bread that gives life.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
