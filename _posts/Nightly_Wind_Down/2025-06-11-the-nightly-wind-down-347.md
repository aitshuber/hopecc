Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest.

And when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. Fix your thoughts on what is true and good and right.

And again, fix your thoughts on what is true and good and right.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, Easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath Back out,

feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note. of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe. A place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety. and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax. And notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety,

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities, just relaxing and releasing. Letting go.

Allow your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Fix your thoughts on what is true and good and right.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
