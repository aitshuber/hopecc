Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest.

And when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

God's Spirit now lives in you. And He will raise you to life by His Spirit.

And again. God's Spirit now lives in you. And he will raise you to life by his spirit.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands. Letting go of the tension in the hands.

Let the palms open. Relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax. And the joints release.

The shoulders. Falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs.

Relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax.

Almost like they're melting.

There is nowhere to go. Nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly normal. how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Notice any feelings that you're having in the body.

Not judging, just noticing.

Allow yourself to release those feelings of tightness and tension.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus.

Just allow yourself to be.

Now, take some nice, deep breaths,

in through the nose and out through the mouth,

just watching the breath,

watching the rise and the fall of the chest,

listening to the sounds of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions,

just taking note of them. And then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward.

Finding that place where you feel loved.

Feel that sense. of natural peace that can only be found in God's presence.

Remember, when you come near to God, He will come near to you.

Take this verse with you. God's Spirit now lives in you, and He will raise you to life by His Spirit.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go. In your presence, I trust your plan for my life.
