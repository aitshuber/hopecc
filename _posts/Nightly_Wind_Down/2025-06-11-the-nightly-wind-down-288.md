Let's take some nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless.

In through the nose and out through the mouth.

Feeling life enter your body. As you breathe in,

inhale, feel how the body expands. Then slowly, exhale, releasing tension as you go.

your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.
