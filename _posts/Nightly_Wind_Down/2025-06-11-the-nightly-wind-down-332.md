Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close, like the sun sets.

Calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

God sent his son into the world. He did not send him to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him.

And again. God sent his son into the world. He did not send him to judge the world guilty, but to save the world through him.

Now bring your attention to the way the body feels.

Notice your breath.

Allow the inhales to expand the body.

Notice how the exhales make you feel.

Feel the body relax. and become heavier.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Soften the forehead down the front of the face.

Allow the neck to relax and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the temples.

Feel the weight of the body. So the arms become heavy.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the bones. become heavy,

letting the breath become natural.

Allow the whole body to soften and release.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy. The

body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One, on the inhale.

and two on the exhale,

three on the next inhale,

and four on the next exhale,

counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay, just start over again. counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath. On

the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

And again, I can do all things through Christ. who strengthens me.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm Beneath those emotions,

maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax. Notice how you feel in this place.

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There is nothing to do. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away, and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale,

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

As you breathe, allow the face to soften and let go.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm.

What is done is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice deep breaths.

Feel the body. become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room,

not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, remember, that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the sounds.

And for a moment or two, effortlessly, allow your awareness to rest.

Take this verse with you. I am with you, and I will protect you everywhere you go.
