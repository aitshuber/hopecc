Begin by taking a few nice, deep breaths,

and as your body begins to relax, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me.

And again. Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me.

Bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders,

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs. the knees.

Relax the calves down to the ankles.

Bring your attention back to the breath,

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale.

Release your anxieties and worries to God.

Let go of that stress.

Let go of your grip on control.

Take a big Deep breath in.

Release your stress.

Let go of your frustrations.

Let it all go on the exhale.

We aren't holding on to the thoughts. We're just letting them release.

Now bring your awareness to the way the body feels.

Allow yourself to sink into your chair or your bed.

Let the body relax. and release.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention to the heart.

Feel the heartbeat,

just noticing it.

Allow that natural rhythm and stillness to relax the body.

Just notice the way that you feel.

not trying to change it, just accepting it the way that it is.

Allow yourself to relax into the loving presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
