just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today,

not engaging with those emotions, remembering that we can leave those feelings. right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out,

without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

Let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

And now to the legs.

Allow the legs to be heavy,

allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale,

and two on the exhale.

Three on the next inhale,

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, it's okay.

There are no expectations.
