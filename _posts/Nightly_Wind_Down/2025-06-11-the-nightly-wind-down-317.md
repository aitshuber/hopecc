and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out.

Without even having to think about it, it just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath in through the nostrils. and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal. There's no destination. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

When it feels natural, begin releasing the tension in your hands. shoulders and neck.

Let go of that stress.

Release your anxieties and worries to God.

Let go of your grip on control.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body,

not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them,

taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm Beneath those emotions,

maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax. Notice how you feel in this place.

surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. There is nowhere to go. There is nothing to do. Here you are.

The thoughts may take you away, and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.
