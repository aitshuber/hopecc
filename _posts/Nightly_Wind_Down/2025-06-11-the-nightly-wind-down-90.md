Begin by getting comfortable and allowing your body to relax.

As you begin to feel your body releasing, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer. Three things will last forever. Faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love.

And again. Three things will last forever. Faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love.

Bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach.

Releasing the hips and the thighs, the knees,

relax the calves, down to the ankles.

Bring your attention back to the breath.

Let's take some nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy. and effortless

in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Inhale, feel how the body expands, then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose

and feel the body fall. With each exhale,

with each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels. Allow

your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes itself.

Take this verse with you. Three things will last forever, faith and love. And the greatest of these is love.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
