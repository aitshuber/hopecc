Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

Calmly, bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Our physical body is becoming older and weaker, but our spirit inside us is made new every day.

And again, our physical body is becoming older and weaker, but our spirit inside us is made new every day.

Bring your attention to the way the breath feels.

Let it settle into a natural rhythm,

effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels. to just breathe.

With each exhale, let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release and unlock.

Feel the effects of gravity on the body, letting gravity pull the body down into the bed or the chair.

Now. Gently bring your attention to your feelings or emotions,

just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today,

not engaging with those emotions, remembering that we can leave those feelings right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts, and then let them be.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room with a nice, easy focus.

Begin to gently notice the breath,

notice the rise and the fall of the breath.

The air moving in and the air moving out

without even having to think about it. It just happens. The breath breathes itself.

Follow the breath. in through the nostrils and into the chest and the abdomen.

Follow the breath back out.

Feel the inhale and relax. Allow the exhale and let go.

This is a safe place. There's no need to rush. God is watching over you and he loves you.

There's no goal, there's no destination.

Rest into that deeper sense of calm that can only be found in God's love.

You're inviting God to bring calm over your body, to bring peace into your spirit. Allow

your awareness to rest with the presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Our physical body is becoming older and weaker, but our spirit inside us is made new every day.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
