Let's start by taking a few nice, deep breaths.

And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close like the sun sets.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

He'll provide you another friend so that you will always have someone with you. This friend. This friend is the Spirit of Truth. You know him already because he has been staying with you and will even be in you.

And again, he'll provide you another friend so that you will always have someone with you. This friend is the Spirit of Truth. You know him already because he has been staying with you and will even be in you.

Now, take some nice, deep breaths,

in through the nose, and out through the mouth,

just watching the breath,

watching the rise and the fall of the chest,

listening to the sounds of your breath.

Notice your feelings and emotions.

just taking note of them and then coming back to the feeling of the breath.

And now, bring your attention to the heart.

Let your awareness settle onto the heartbeat.

Allow your awareness to fall and move inward,

finding that place where you feel loved. Feel that sense of

natural peace. that can only be found in God's presence.

With an easy awareness, begin to bring your attention to the space in the room,

not examining it, just sensing it.

Notice your place in the room,

just observing.

Listen to the sounds in the room. Maybe it's a quiet room, or maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening. and enjoying the sounds. Not wishing to change or get rid of the sounds, just accepting them.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness back to the body, noticing the weight of the body.

Allow the body to relax as it becomes heavier.

Allow yourself to leave the day behind.

Let go of the stress, being mindful. To stay present in this moment,

let yourself unwind and naturally relax in the presence of God.

Remember, when you come near to God, He will come near to you.

Take this verse with you. He'll provide you another friend so that you will always have someone with you. This friend is the Spirit of Truth. You know Him already. I trust that he has been staying with you AND WILL EVEN BE IN YOU.

God, I know that you are always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go of your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
