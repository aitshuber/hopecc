Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer.

May the Lord bless you and protect you. May the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord show you His favor. and give you his peace.

Again, may the Lord bless you and protect you. May the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord show you his favor and give you his peace.

Now, take a moment to be grateful for this opportunity to relax.

Notice how good it feels just to be here. In this moment,

take a few nice, big, deep breaths in.

Allow your body and mind to relax.

Nothing else matters right now. Here you are.

Allow your body to relax and feel the calm of God's presence.

The thoughts may take you away, and that's okay. Don't resist the thoughts. Don't force them back. Be friendly with your thoughts.

When it feels natural, come back to the feeling of relaxation in the body.

Now, without changing the breath, notice the quiet sound of your breathing.

Notice how good it feels. Just to breathe.

Allow your breath to make the body feel heavy.

Let the body relax a little more into your bed.

And on your next inhale, begin to count the breath.

1 on the inhale,

and 2 on the exhale.

3 on the next inhale,

and 4 on the next exhale.

Counting up to 10. and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There's nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We're just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Notice how the body is feeling. It might feel good, or it might not. Either way, It's okay.

There are no expectations.

And now, for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

Take this verse with you. May the Lord bless you and protect you. May the Lord smile on you and be gracious to you. May the Lord show you his favor and give you his peace.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
