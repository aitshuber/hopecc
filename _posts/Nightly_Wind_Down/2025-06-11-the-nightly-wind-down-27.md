Begin by getting comfortable, and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to relax, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will neither fail you. nor abandon you.

And again, do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body.

Not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them.

Taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe. a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

In this place of safety, begin to notice how your body feels,

consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness. back to this place of love and safety.

Surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

Now, let's relax the muscles. Start with the hands, letting go of the tension, in the hands.

Let the palms open and relax each finger.

Let your grip relax.

Let the arms relax and the joints release,

the shoulders falling away from the ears.

Feel the weight of the body.

And now to the legs,

relaxing and letting go.

Allow the legs to be heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely relax,

almost like they're melting.

If you need a deep breath, take it. Keep it easy and natural.

Notice how the breath changes the way you feel.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. You are here.

Everything is perfectly how it should be.

Let your mind relax. You are safe.

Allow yourself to release those feelings of tightness and tension.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus.

Just allow yourself to be.

Take this verse with you. Do not be afraid. Or discouraged for the Lord will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
