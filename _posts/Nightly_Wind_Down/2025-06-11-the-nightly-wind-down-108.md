Let's get started by taking a moment just to be thankful for all the blessings in life.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse and prayer. Anyone who drinks the water I give will never be thirsty again. The water I give people will And

again, anyone who drinks the water I give will never be thirsty again. The water I give people will be like a spring flowing inside them. It will bring them eternal life.

Now, bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless.

In through the nose and out through the mouth.

Feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale. Feel how the body expands. Then slowly exhale. Releasing tension as you go,

feel the air as it travels in through the nose,

and feel the body fall with each exhale.

With each breath, allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels. Allow

your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes itself.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice, deep breaths.

Allow your breathing to relax the mind.

Feel the body. Become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room,

not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, remember, that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the sounds.

And for a moment or two, effortlessly, allow your awareness to rest.

Take this verse with you. Anyone who drinks the water I give will never be thirsty again. The water I give people. Your formations versus yesterday will be like a spring flowing inside them. It will bring them eternal life. God, I know you're always with me.

for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
