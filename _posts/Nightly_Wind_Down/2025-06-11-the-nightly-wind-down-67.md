Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest.

And when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. With His love, He will calm all your fears.

And again. With His love, He will calm all your fears.

Bring your attention. to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders.

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs. The knees,

relax the calves, down to the ankles.

Now bring your attention to the breath,

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale,

taking some nice, slow, Deep, full breaths

in through the nose and letting go out through the mouth.

Deep breath in and feel the body expand and slowly exhaling, letting all the air out of the lungs.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale.

And feel the body relax with each exhale.

Feel the weight of the body in the bed or the chair.

Allow the forehead to relax and the jaw to fall away from the face.

Just relaxing and releasing.

Now, let go of the breath. Let it find a nice, natural, effortless rhythm. Simply let go.

Take this verse with you. With his love, he will calm all your fears.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
