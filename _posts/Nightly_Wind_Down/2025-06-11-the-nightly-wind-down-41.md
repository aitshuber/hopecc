Begin by getting comfortable, and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to relax, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.

And again. For I know the plans I have for you. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you hope and a future.

Now bring your attention to the breath.

Let's take some nice deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless

in through the nose. and out through the mouth,

feeling life enter your body as you breathe in.

Inhale, feel how the body expands, then slowly exhale, releasing tension as you go.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose,

and feel the body fall with each exhale,

with each breath. Allow the chest and shoulders to soften and relax.

Notice how the body feels.

Allow your breath to soften and release the tension in your body.

Just relaxing and releasing.

There's no way to do this wrong. The breath breathes. itself.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you in the body.

Not placing judgment on the feelings or engaging with them, just noticing them.

Taking note of the emotions and then letting them go.

Begin to notice that deeper sense of calm beneath those emotions.

Maybe even begin to visualize a place that feels safe, a place where you feel loved and taken care of.

This is a place of safety and acceptance.

God loves you and wants you to feel loved. He wants you to feel a sense of security in Him.

Begin to notice how your body feels. Consciously relaxing the body and allowing God's presence to calm your mind.

For a moment or two, relax and notice how you feel in this place.

If the mind wanders off, that's okay. When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to this place of love and safety.

Surrendering all of your worried thoughts, your stresses, and maybe even your responsibilities. Just relaxing and releasing, letting go.

And now, let your mind go where it wants to go.

Take this verse with you. For I know the plans I have for you. Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans to give you hope and a future.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.


Let's begin by consciously turning off the body,

and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close. Like the sun sets,

calmly bring your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer.

I sought the Lord, and He answered me. He delivered me from my fears.

And again, I sought the Lord, and He answered me. He delivered me from my fears.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice, deep breaths.

Allow your breathing to relax the mind.

Feel the body become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room,

not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, remember that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the sounds.

And for a moment or two, Effortlessly allow your awareness to rest.

Bring your attention to the heartbeat.

Allow its rhythm to relax your body,

letting the arms and legs become heavy.

Now bring your awareness to the top of the head. Allow the head to soften all the way down the face,

softening the skin on the face

and the eyes.

Soften the throat. and the back of the neck.

Soften the collarbone,

the shoulders,

and the arms,

releasing the elbows.

Let the wrists and the hands relax,

softening the chest and the stomach,

releasing the hips and the thighs, the knees.

Relax the calves down to the ankles.

Bring your attention back to the breath,

just noticing the inhale

and the exhale.

Take this verse with you, I sought the Lord and he answered me. He delivered me from my fears.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
