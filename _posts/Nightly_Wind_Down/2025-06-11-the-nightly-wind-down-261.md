Begin by getting comfortable and allowing your body to relax.

As you begin to feel your body releasing, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Let your awareness rest with this verse and prayer.

This is my commandment. Love each other in the same way I have loved you.

And again, this is my commandment. Love each other in the same way I have loved you.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done is done,

all you have is this moment.

Take a few nice, deep breaths,

allow your breathing to relax the mind,

feel the body become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body. and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise,

and exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room,

not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, Remember, that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the sounds.

Now bring your attention to the way the body feels.

Notice your breath.

Allow the inhales to expand the body.

Notice how the exhales make you feel.

Feel the body relax and become heavier.

Now, soften the forehead. down the front of the face.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Allow the neck to relax and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the temples.

Feel the weight of the body, so the arms become heavy.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the bones become heavy.

Allow the whole body. to soften and release.

Now, give yourself a moment to relax and totally let go.

Take this verse with you. This is my commandment. Love each other in the same way I have loved you.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
