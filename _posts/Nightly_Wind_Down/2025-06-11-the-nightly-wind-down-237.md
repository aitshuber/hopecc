Begin by getting comfortable, and when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to relax, allow your awareness to rest with this verse and prayer. This hope will not lead to disappointment, for we know how dearly God loves us.

And again, this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body. Slowly begin to let those muscles relax and release.

Give yourself permission to let go of today.

What is done, is done. is done.

All you have is this moment.

Take a few nice, deep breaths.

Allow your breathing to relax the mind.

Feel the body become heavier,

sinking into your bed, letting go of all that stress in the body and the mind.

Inhale, feel the chest rise.

And exhale, feel the chest fall.

Let the breath find a natural rhythm.

Begin to notice the sounds in the room.

Not resisting the sounds, just accepting them as they are. You are just the observer.

If the thoughts take you away, remember that's okay. There's no way to do this wrong.

Bring your attention to the way the breath feels.

Let it settle into a natural rhythm,

effortless and natural.

Notice how good it feels to just breathe.

With each exhale, let the body feel heavier and heavier.

Begin to allow the muscles to release and unlock.

Feel the effects of gravity. on the body.

Now, gently bring your attention to your feelings or emotions.

Just noticing the feelings that you brought with you today.

Not engaging with those emotions. Remembering that we can leave those feelings right where they are.

The day is done. Allow God to handle what you cannot.

The thoughts may begin to bubble up, and that's okay.

Just notice the thoughts and then let them be.

Rest into that deeper sense of calm that can only be found in God's love.

You're inviting God to bring calm over your body, to bring peace into your spirit,

resting into your true nature. A Child of God.

Take this verse with you. This hope will not lead to disappointment, for we know how dearly God loves us.

God, I know you're always with me. Thank you for all of your blessings. Help me to relax and let go in your presence. I trust your plan for my life.
