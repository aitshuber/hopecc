It says in the Bible that your name is written on God's heart. That is a powerful image. You aren't just important to God, you're always on his mind and in his heart. Today as you meditate, remember that you are loved.

Okay, let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Now take a moment to consider this verse, I have loved you with a love that lasts forever.

And again, I have loved you with a love that lasts forever.

Now, bring your attention to to the way the body feels.

Just noticing any areas of tightness in the body.

If it feels comfortable, take a few nice deep breaths.

Allow your breath to loosen any areas of tightness in the body.

With each breath, allow a sense of calm To wash over your body.

Allow your body to totally release and let go.

Now bring your attention to the top of the head.

Begin to soften the forehead, down the front of the face.

Relax the corners of the eyes.

Allow the neck to relax. and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the temples.

The legs are becoming heavy.

Feel the weight of the body.

Let your whole body soften and release.

Allow your mind to rest with the presence of God.

Now bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body.

Slowly bring your attention to those areas of tightness and relax them piece by piece.

As your body begins to relax, allow your mind to let go.

Give yourself permission to start fresh.

What is done is done. All you have is this moment.

This is a safe place. Release your thoughts to God.

When it feels comfortable, take a few nice deep breaths.

Inhale, feel the chest rise, and exhale, feel the chest fall.

There's no way to do this wrong

if the thoughts take you away. That's okay. When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the feeling of the breath.

Take this verse with you. I have loved you with a love that lasts forever.

When you feel ready, slowly bring your awareness back to the breath and allow your eyes to open. Take a few deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth. Notice how you feel.

I hope you feel a little more relaxed. We'll see you again tomorrow with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
