When learning how to meditate, it's so easy to want to chase that desire to accomplish. You want to be good at meditating so you can reach that place of wisdom and peace. And that's totally normal and natural to want that. But in many ways, it misses the point. This mindset distorts the act of mindfulness because by chasing the goal of being good at something, we in essence miss the beauty of the experience.

So today, let's keep it simple and just focus on acceptance and awareness. Okay, let's go ahead and get started by getting comfortable in your chair.

And when you're ready, take a few nice deep breaths. Deep breaths and allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to settle, take a moment to consider this verse. Now I can say to myself, relax. The image is a reflection of the maxillofacial experience. The image is a person talking to themselves. The image is a person interacting with the colors

of the sky. The image is a scene from a movie or a scene from a book. The image is a person and an image of a person and an image of a scene.

Let's take a nice big breath.

With each breath, allow the body to become softer and more relaxed,

almost like a wave of relaxation washing over the body.

The breath fills up the body and then it gives way to that natural relaxation that's right under the surface.

Now, let's turn our awareness. To how the body feels.

Just examining the body with an easy curiosity. Allow

your shoulders to relax and fall away from the ears.

Relax your arms and allow your hands to open and let go.

Allow your temples. Face to relax.

Let the throat and the neck soften.

Allow your breath to deepen. As your awareness rests deeper,

just relaxing and releasing.

You are here and everything is okay. God is with you.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus and allow yourself to simply be.

Gently bring your awareness to any sensations you're feeling,

just noticing the sensations on the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin or the weight of the body in the chair.

Just noticing and welcoming these sensations as part of the meditation.

Notice the rise and the fall of the chest as you breathe.

Follow the breath and notice how it changes your body.

The inhales, expanding the body and filling it up with life. And the exhales. Relaxing the body, letting go.

Follow the breath as it comes in through the nose and then goes back out through the mouth.

You don't have to do anything. It's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You are simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

This is a safe place of love and deep rest.

Allow your mind to take refuge in God.

Take this verse with you. Now I can say to myself, relax and rest. For the Lord rewards fully those who simply trust in Him.

Gently bring your awareness back to the body. And when you feel ready, slowly open your eyes. and take a nice, deep breath. Sit back and relax for a moment. How do you feel? I hope you feel a little better. We'll see you next time with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
