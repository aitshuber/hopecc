It's pretty common to worry about the future. We want things to go a certain way, and that's normal. We may not always understand the way things go, but we can trust that God has a plan for our lives. Whatever chapter you're in, remember that your story has a happy ending. You are saved by love. Take that with you as you go about your day.

Okay, let's begin by consciously relaxing the body. And when you're ready, allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to settle, take a moment To consider this verse, For I know the plans I have for you, they are plans for good and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.

And again, For I know the plans I have for you, they are plans for good. and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.

With an easy awareness, bring your attention to the space in the room,

just noticing the space. With an easy curiosity,

notice your place in the room.

Feel the weight of your body.

Feel the air on your skin.

Listen to the sounds in the room.

Maybe it's quiet in the room. Maybe it's not. Both are okay.

You're just listening and welcoming the sounds as part of the exercise.

Not wishing to change the sounds. Just accepting the sounds as they are.

When it feels natural, slowly bring your awareness to the breath.

Allow your breath to be a reminder to stay in this present moment.

If your mind begins to wander, You can always come back to the feeling of the breath.

Relax and let your body honor the natural calm that only comes from the presence of a loving God.

With ease, bring your attention to the breath.

Take a few nice Deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless.

Feel life. Enter your body as you breathe in,

and then release your tension as you breathe out.

Inhale. Feel how the body expands. Then slowly exhale, feeling the body fall.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose. And follow the air back out through the mouth.

Allow each breath to soften the chest and relax the shoulders.

Begin to scan the body from the head to the toe. Relaxing the body piece by piece.

There's no way.

And now, for a few moments, allow your mind to do what it wants to do.

If it wants to think, then let it think. And if it wants to rest, then let it rest.

Take this verse with you, for I know the plans I have for you. They are plans for good, and not for evil, to give you a future. And a hope.

Allow your awareness to slowly come back to your body. And when it feels natural, begin to open your eyes. Sit back in your chair. Maybe you want to stretch a little bit. Do whatever feels good. Take a moment to notice how you feel. I hope you feel a little more relaxed. We'll see you again tomorrow for another day of hope.
