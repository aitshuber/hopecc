Meditation is not about moving away from your life to some other reality. It's about accepting your life as it is and embracing your life fully. It's about accepting both the good and the bad and coming to peace with it. Okay, let's go ahead and get started by getting comfortable in your chair. And when you're ready, take a few nice, deep breaths and allow your eyes to open.

slowly close.

Just like loosening your grip, you're letting go of those feelings.

Let the inhale come easily and effortlessly,

and then exhale, controlling the breath.

Allow yourself to be here in this moment.

This is all that matters right now.

Whatever you need to let go of, let it go. Release it to God.

Today is a new day with new opportunities.

Allow your breath to renew your spirit and connect you to your creator who loves you. Deep breath, in through the nose and out through the

mouth.

Remember, this is a place of love. Let this practice be whatever you need it to be. God's calming presence is always accessible to you.

Let your awareness rest in the loving presence of God.

Take this verse with you. In this world, you will have troubles. But be brave. I have defeated the world.

Gently bring your awareness back to the body, and when you feel ready, slowly open your eyes and take a nice deep breath. Sit back and relax for a moment. How do you feel? I hope you feel a little better. We'll see you next time. With hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
