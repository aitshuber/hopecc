Today, as we start our meditation, let's strip away all of the instruction and the baggage of doing. I want you to just experience it. You already inherently know how to relax, and just be with God. Take a minute just to breathe and be here in this moment.

Let's go ahead and get started by gently bringing your attention to the breath.

Notice the rise and the fall of the chest.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse. But to all who believed him, and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.

And again, but to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.

Now, bring your attention to your breath. Just a soft, easy awareness.

Notice what it feels like as air passes in through the nose and then back out through the mouth.

Let the breath bring life to your body.

Begin to listen to the sound of your breath,

listening to the inhale and the exhale.

On the next exhale allow the breath to relax. Become natural.

Allow your breath to bring renewal to your body.

You're making space to notice God's presence in your life.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention to the heartbeat. Allow

that rhythm and stillness to enter every part of your body.

Feel the presence of God in this space.

Gently bring your awareness to any sensations you're feeling.

Just noticing the sensations on the body.

Maybe it's the air on the skin or the weight of the body in the chair.

Just noticing and welcoming these sensations as part of the meditation.

Notice the rise and the fall of the chest as you breathe.

Follow the breath and notice how it changes your body.

The inhales, expanding the body and filling it up with life. And the exhales, relaxing the body, letting go.

You don't have to do anything, it's natural and effortless. Your body knows how to relax.

You are simply unearthing the calm that was already there.

This is a safe place of love and deep rest.

Allow your mind to rest. to take refuge in God.

Take this verse with you. But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.

Gently bring your awareness back to the feeling of the body. Notice the weight of the body on the chair, and when you feel ready, allow your eyes to open. and take a nice deep breath. Notice how your breath changes the way you feel. I hope you feel a little more in touch with God. We'll see you again next time with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
