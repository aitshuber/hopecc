Part of being able to recognize God's presence in our life is learning to be humble. Humility allows us to hear God speak to us and guide our path. Humility allows us to see reality and to see truth. Remind yourself of that as you meditate today. Let's begin by loosening the chest,

and when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse, you created my inmost being, you knit me together in my mothers womb

and again you created my inmost being, you knit me together in my mothers womb.

With ease, bring your attention to the breath.

Take a few nice, deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless.

Feel life enter your body as you breathe in, and then release your tension as you breathe out.

Inhale, feel how the body expands. Then slowly exhale, feeling the body fall.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose and follow the air back out through the mouth.

Allow each breath to soften the chest and relax the shoulders.

Begin to scan the body from the head to the toe, relaxing the body piece by piece.

There's no way to do this wrong.

And now, for a few moments, allow your mind to do what it wants to do.

If it wants to think, then let it think, and if it wants to rest, then let it rest.

Bring your attention to any tightness in the body,

just noticing how the body feels.

Start by relaxing the hands, letting go of any tension in the hands.

Allow the arms to totally relax, letting go at the elbows and the wrists.

Let the shoulders fall away from the ears.

Let the legs become heavy.

Allow the muscles to relax. And

now, if it feels comfortable, take a big, deep breath, letting the air fill up the body.

Notice how the breath changes the way the body feels.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus. And just allow yourself to be.

Take this verse with you. You created my inmost being. You knit me together in my mother's womb.

Slowly bring your awareness back to the body, and when you feel ready, allow your eyes to open. Take a moment. Notice how your body feels. I hope you feel a little better. We'll see you again tomorrow with hope, mindfulness, and prayer. Remember, be easy with yourself.
