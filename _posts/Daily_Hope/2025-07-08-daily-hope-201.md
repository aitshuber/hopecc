If you feel like your heart has never found a home, you're not alone. We're made in God's image, and until we know God, and in turn know ourselves, we'll always feel like something's missing. Trust that by spending this time in meditation and prayer, you're moving closer to becoming whole. OK. Let's go ahead and get started by getting comfortable in your chair.

And when you're ready, take a few nice, deep breaths and allow your eyes to slowly close.

As your body begins to settle, take a moment to consider this verse.

Those who find me. Find life, and the Lord will be pleased with them.

And again, those who find me, find life, and the Lord will be pleased with them.

Now bring your attention to the position of the body.

Make sure you can breathe in an open and natural way.

Allow the chest to open and take a few nice deep breaths.

Let the breath fill the body up with life.

With each breath you're bringing your awareness into this moment.

Relax and allow God to speak to you in the way that he wants.

Let your thoughts go and allow your awareness to rest in this moment.

If your thoughts wander off, that's okay. It's natural for the thoughts to drift.

As best you can, leave those thoughts right where they are and come back to that feeling of your body.

Our feelings and emotions can distract us from the natural calm of God's love.

There isn't anything to discover. It's always been there.

This is a safe place. God loves you.

Gradually, and with ease, bring your awareness to rest on your breath.

Feel the body rise with each inhale.

Notice how with each breath the body feels a little calmer.

Begin to notice the space around the body.

Feel the contact of the body on the chair and your feet on the floor.

When you feel comfortable, begin to scan the entire body to build up a picture of what the body feels like.

Piece by piece, release any areas of tension.

Let go of your stress. Let go of your anxiety.

You are exactly where you're meant to be.

Allow that natural rhythm of the breath to relax you.

Let your breath guide you to a place of safety in the presence of God.

You are accepted here. You are loved.

Take this verse with you.

Those who find me find life, and the Lord will be pleased with them.

Gently bring your awareness back to the body. And when you feel ready, slowly open your eyes. and take a nice deep breath. Sit back and relax for a moment. How do you feel?

I hope you feel a little better. We'll see you next time with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
