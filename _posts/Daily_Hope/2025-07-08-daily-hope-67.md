An interesting way to find peace in the moment is to imagine yourself as a witness to your own thoughts and emotions. Rather than living in your thoughts, rest into God's presence and experience His love. Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest.

And when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse. Oh Lord, You give me light, You dispel my darkness.

And again, Oh Lord, You give me light, You dispel my darkness.

Let's begin to take note of how the body is feeling.

Not really thinking too much about it, just letting go of those feelings of tightness and tension.

When it feels comfortable, take a few deep breaths

in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Deep breath in, expanding the body and filling the chest up,

and exhale, feeling the chest fall and let go.

Take another big, deep breath in, and control the exhale. Letting it take twice as long as the inhale.

With each breath, allow the tension to melt away from the body.

Now, allow your breath to take up a natural rhythm.

Let the gentle sound of your breathing relax your mind.

There is no way to do this wrong. Just an easy, effortless awareness,

letting go.

When it feels comfortable, take a few nice, deep breaths in,

really making a point to expand the body and expand the chest.

Notice how the breath makes you feel.

Now let the breath begin to settle.

As your breath begins to settle, allow the body to become heavy.

Notice any sensations in the body. See if you're holding on to any tension.

Maybe the body is tight, or maybe it's not. Either is okay.

You're just scanning the body, looking for any areas of tightness. and letting them release.

And if the mind drifts away in thought, slowly bring it back to the feelings in the body and the breath.

Your body knows how to relax.

You don't have to think about it for it to happen. You are simply uncovering the calm. that was always present.

Let your awareness rest in the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. O Lord, you give me light, you dispel my darkness.

Slowly begin to bring your awareness back to the body. Maybe even move your fingers and toes a little bit. When it feels natural, allow your eyes to slowly open. Take another big deep breath in and let it out with a sigh. Notice how you feel. I hope you feel a little more relaxed. We'll see you again tomorrow with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
