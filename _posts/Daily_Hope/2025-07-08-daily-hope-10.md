God tells us to cast our anxiety on Him because He cares. This is something we can learn to do every day. Rely on the one who loves you and watches over you. Today, ask God to fill your spirit.

Okay, let's begin by getting comfortable and taking a few deep breaths.

As you begin to feel your body releasing, allow your eyes to slowly close.

Now take a moment to consider this verse, peace I leave with you. My peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.

And again, peace I leave with you. My peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.

Bring your attention to any tightness in the body,

just noticing how the body feels.

Start by relaxing the hands. Letting go of any tension in the hands.

Allow the arms totally relax. Letting go at the elbows and the wrists.

Let the shoulders fall away from the ears.

Let the legs become heavy.

Allow the muscles to completely let go.

Let your body totally relax and release.

And now, if it feels comfortable, take a big, deep breath, letting the air fill up the body.

Feel the chest rise on the inhale

and fall on the exhale.

Notice how the breath changes the way the body feels.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus and just allow yourself to be.

Now, let's take some nice, deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Just noticing and observing the breath. Watching the rise and the fall of the chest.

Listen to the gentle sound of your breathing.

Begin to notice any feelings. you may have brought with you today.

Thoughts are a natural part of meditation.

Just leave those feelings right where they are and then gently come back to the feeling of the breath.

Long, deep inhale. Then a slow, controlled exhale. Allow

the breath, calm the mind, and relax the body.

And now, allow your awareness to fall and move inward, finding that place where you feel love.

Feel that natural peace in God's presence.

Remember, when you come near to God, He will come near to you.

Take this verse with you. Peace. I leave with you my peace I give you and do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.

Gently bring your awareness back to the feeling of your breath. Listen to the sound of your breathing and when you're ready, slowly open your eyes and take another deep breath in. Give yourself a stretch and sit back and relax. Remember to take a moment to check in and notice how you feel. I hope you feel better.

Take care, and we'll see you again tomorrow with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
