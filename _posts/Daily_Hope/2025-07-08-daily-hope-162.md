Your thoughts and emotions will define your experience.

If your experience of life is negative, it's okay. Try to begin to accept your experience as it is. Let your soul settle into God's arms. Over time, your spirit will learn to rest and trust God's plan for your life. Today, as you meditate. Allow your spirit to rest. Okay, let's get started by allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes close like the sun sets.

Now take a moment to consider this verse. We are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God's perfect plan.

And again, we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God's perfect plan.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Not really examining it, just noticing the space with an easy curiosity.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds in the room.

Just a nice, Easy focus on the sounds in the room.

Listen to the gentle sound of your breathing.

Notice the rise and the fall of the chest.

Maybe the breath is shallow, or maybe it's deep. Both are okay. Just follow the breath as it moves through your body.

Let the rhythm of your breath relax your mind.

This is a safe place. God is watching over you

with ease. Bring your attention to the breath.

Take a few nice deep breaths.

Make them feel easy and effortless. Feel

life. Enter your body as you breathe in.

And then release your tension as you breathe out.

Inhale, feel how the body expands. Then slowly exhale, feeling the body fall.

Feel the air as it travels in through the nose, and follow the air back out through the mouth.

Allow each breath to soften the chest. and relax the shoulders.

Begin to scan the body from the head to the toe, relaxing the body piece by piece.

There is no way to do this wrong.

And now, for a few moments, allow your mind do what it wants to do.

If it wants to think, then let it think. And if it wants to rest, then let it rest.

Take this verse with you. We are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God's perfect plan.

When you feel ready, slowly bring your awareness back to the breath and allow your eyes to open. Take a few deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Notice how you feel.

I hope you feel a little more relaxed. We'll see you again tomorrow with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
