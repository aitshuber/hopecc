Relationships take time and effort. They don't just happen by chance. They only grow through communication. Through talking and listening. When we pray, we talk to God. But when we meditate, we listen for God. As you spend time in meditation, practice listening without any expectation. When you feel ready, go ahead and get comfortable in your position.

Really allowing the body to relax.

And when you're ready, let your eyes slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse. Do everything in love

again. Do everything in love.

Now, bring your awareness to the feeling of the body.

Maybe there's some muscle tightness or stress lingering in the body.

Slowly, bring your attention to those areas of tightness and relax them, piece by piece.

Feel the weight of your body in the chair.

As your body begins to relax, allow your mind to let go.

Give yourself permission to start fresh.

What is done is done. All you have is this moment.

This is a safe place. Release your thoughts. When

it feels comfortable, take a few nice, deep breaths.

Inhale, feel the chest rise, and exhale, feel the chest fall.

There's no way to do this wrong.

If the thoughts take you away, that's okay. When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness back to the feeling of the breath.

Let's take a few nice, deep breaths.

Allow your breath to fill the body up.

And then relax with each out breath.

With each new breath, allow the chest to open and the body to relax.

Let go of any tension in your body.

Just focus your attention on the breath. Deep breaths

in through the nose. and out through the mouth.

And when it feels comfortable, begin to count the breath.

One on the inhale, and two on the exhale.

Three on the next inhale, and four on the next exhale. Counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

Now let go of the counting, and bring your attention. To the sound of your breathing.

Just a nice, soft focus on the air coming in and the air going out.

Just relaxing and releasing. Allow

your awareness to rest with the breath.

Take this verse with you. Do everything in love.

Softly, begin to bring your awareness back to the body. Back to that feeling of weight in the body. And when you're ready, slowly open your eyes and take a big deep breath in. Take a moment to check in and notice how you feel. I hope you feel a little more present. We'll see you again tomorrow for another day of hope.

Take care.
