When we meditate, we're creating space in our mind and soul for God's grace, a place where we feel loved by the one who has loved us from the beginning of time. We are allowing ourselves to be open to the hand of grace. We're opening up to God's love. Okay, let's go ahead and get started by getting comfortable in your chair.

And when you're ready, take a few nice deep breaths. Deep breaths and allow your eyes to slowly close.

Now take a moment to consider this verse, You are God's chosen treasure.

And again, You are God's chosen treasure.

When it feels comfortable, go ahead and take a few deep breaths in.

Nice and easy,

let the breath settle and become natural and bring your attention to the space in the room.

Not thinking too hard about it, just becoming aware of your body and your surroundings.

Notice the air on the skin,

feel the chair beneath you.

Pay attention to the position of your body. Make sure that you're comfortable.

Notice the state of your mind.

Does the mind feel calm? Does it feel restless? Both are okay.

Just a simple, easy noticing.

Just noticing the space, almost like you're an observer.

Notice the gentle sound of your breath coming in and going out.

Deepening the inhales and extending the exhales. Letting the body rest.

Just relax.

Let's begin to take note of how the body is feeling.

Not really thinking too much about it. Just letting go of those feelings of tightness and tension.

When it feels comfortable, take a few deep breaths

in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Deep breath in, expanding the body and filling the chest up,

and exhale, feeling the chest fall and let go.

Take another big, deep breath in and control the exhale, letting it take twice as long as the inhale.

With each breath, allow the tension to melt away from the body.

Now, allow your breath to take up a natural rhythm.

Let the gentle sound of your breathing Relax your mind.

There is no way to do this wrong, just an easy, effortless awareness.

Letting go.

Take this verse with you. You are God's chosen treasure.

Gently bring your awareness back to the body, and when you feel ready, Slowly open your eyes and take a nice deep breath. Sit back and relax for a moment. How do you feel? I hope you feel a little better. We'll see you next time with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
