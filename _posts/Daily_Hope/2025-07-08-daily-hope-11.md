Stepping away from busyness and constant stimulation can feel somewhat like a physical withdrawal. It can also create impatience with the process. By meditating, you'll eventually break this unhealthy addiction to busyness. You will find peace and tranquility. Take that with you as you begin this meditation.

Okay, let's go ahead and get started by getting comfortable in your chair. And when you're ready, take a few nice, deep breaths. and allow your eyes to slowly close.

Now take a moment to consider this verse. Keep on seeking and you will find. Keep on knocking and the door will be open to you.

And again, keep on seeking and you will find. Keep on knocking and the door will be open to you.

Bring your attention to any emotions. You're carrying with you,

not engaging with your feelings, just noticing them.

Almost like you're observing your emotions and then letting them go.

Just like loosening your grip, you're letting go of those feelings.

Let God handle whatever is out of your control.

This is a place of acceptance and safety. You can always find rest in God.

Now, begin to notice how your body feels.

When it feels comfortable, begin to consciously relax the body.

Scanning down from your head to your toes, release any areas of tension in the body.

Surrender all of your stress. and all of your responsibilities, and just let your mind rest.

You are safe. God is looking out for you.

Now, gently bring your awareness to the breath. Allow your breath to deepen. Fill the lungs.

Big, deep breath in and then taking twice as long on the exhale.

Let the inhale come easily and effortlessly

and then exhale, controlling the breath.

Allow yourself to be here in this moment.

This is all that matters right now.

Whatever you need to let go of, let it go. Release it to God.

Today is a new day. with new opportunities.

Allow your breath to renew your spirit and connect you to your creator who loves you.

Deep breath. In through the nose and out through the mouth.

Remember, this is a place of love. Let this practice be whatever you need it to be. God's calming presence always accessible to you.

Let your awareness rest in the loving presence of God.

Take this verse with you. Keep on seeking and you will find. Keep on knocking and the door will be opened to you.

Gently bring your awareness back to the body and when you feel ready, slowly open your eyes And take a nice deep breath. Sit back and relax for a moment. How do you feel? I hope you feel a little better. We'll see you next time with hope, mindfulness, and prayer.
