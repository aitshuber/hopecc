When meditating, it's so important to remain open. Try not to hold on to the way you believe things should be. Accept things as they are. Know that life is messy, but God is at work in your life. Let's begin by allowing the body to become heavy.

And as you begin to relax, allow your eyes to close.

Now take a moment to consider this verse. Even if I walk into trouble, you will keep my life safe.

And again, even if I walk into trouble, you will keep my life safe.

With a gradual ease, take a nice big breath.

Be intentional with the breath.

Big, deep inhales. And nice, long exhales.

Relax and settle into your body.

With each breath, allow the muscles to soften and let go.

Feel that sense of gravity and weight in the body.

You're just uncovering the natural calm that's always accessible through God.

Now, with ease. Bring your awareness to the sounds in the room,

just listening to the sounds with an easy curiosity,

not placing judgment on the sounds, just noticing the sounds and accepting them as part of this practice. If

the thoughts take you away, it's okay. When you notice the thoughts, gently bring your awareness back to the sounds,

just noticing and listening.

Now, for a moment or two, let your awareness go where it wants to go.

Now, bring your attention to the way it feels when you breathe.

Feel the stomach and the chest rise with each inhale

and feel the body relax with each exhale.

In through the nose, feel the body expand and then slowly exhale.

Let the breath be natural. Let the breath naturally relax the body.

Allow the face and the neck to soften.

Allow the forehead to relax and the shoulders to fall away from the ears.

Relax the body and allow the chair to hold the body up.

Just relaxing and letting the body unwind.

Simply let go.

Take this verse with you. Even if I walk into trouble, you will keep my life safe.

When it feels easy, bring your attention back to the feeling of the breath. Take a few more deep breaths and slowly allow your eyes to open. Notice how the breath changes the way you feel. I hope you feel a little more relaxed. We'll see you again tomorrow. Take care of yourself.
