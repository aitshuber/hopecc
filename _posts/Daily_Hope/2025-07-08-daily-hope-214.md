The mystery of life is in the moment before you. It's not in the past or in the future. Memories and hopes are important, but they're not life. Life is only lived in the present, the eternal now. As you meditate today, allow yourself to experience this moment. And let your heart open to the presence of God's love.

Let's begin by loosening the shoulders and the chest.

And when you feel ready, just allow the eyes to slowly close.

Take a moment to consider this verse.

Look, I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and we will share a meal together as friends.

And again. Look, I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in and we will share a meal together as friends.

Now Slowly begin to take some deep breaths, allowing the body to open.

Let the breath relax any areas of tightness in the body.

Consciously start to turn the muscles off.

Start with the muscles in the feet and the legs.

Allow the feet to open. to be heavy on the floor.

Allow the chest and the back to open so the breathing can become deep and natural.

Soften the shoulders. Allow them to fall away from the ears.

Let the head fall and become heavy at the neck.

Feel the weight of the body. and how it pushes you down into the chair.

When it feels comfortable, bring your awareness to the sound of your breath.

Not changing anything about the breath, just noticing it.

Listening to the gentle rhythm of the inhales and exhales.

Filling the body up. with fresh air,

and then slowly exhaling and letting go.

Let your mind be still.

Now, take a moment to be grateful for this opportunity to relax.

Notice how good it feels just to be here in this moment. it,

when it feels natural. Begin to deepen the breath.

Let go of your worries and focus your attention on the breath.

Nothing else matters right now. You are here. There is nothing to do but relax.

Allow your body to honor the natural calm given by God's presence.

Just listening to the breath, noticing the rise and the fall of the chest.

Deep breath in, expanding the body, and then exhale, letting your awareness rest.

Take another deep breath as you feel your lungs expand,

and exhale, following the air. back out through the mouth.

The thoughts may take you away, and that's okay.

With each breath, effortlessly rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you.

I stand at the door and knock. If you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in, and we will share a meal together as friends.

Slowly bring your awareness. Back to the body. And when you feel ready, allow your eyes to open. Take a moment to notice how your body feels. I hope you feel a little better. We'll see you again tomorrow with hope, mindfulness, and prayer. Remember, be easy with yourself.
