Something interesting happens when we experience the Bible through meditation rather than studying it. When we study the Bible with our learning, active brain, we can conceptualize its meaning. When we experience the Bible through meditation and prayer, we get to experience its meaning in our heart. We move from knowing God in our head to feeling him in our heart.

Let's start by taking a few nice deep breaths.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your eyes to close like the sun sets.

Now take a moment to consider this verse. He heals the brokenhearted and bandages their wounds.

And again. He heals the brokenhearted. and bandages their wounds.

With a gentle ease, let's go ahead and take a nice deep breath.

Notice how good it feels just to breathe.

Allow your inhales to fill the body up,

and then totally relax the body on the exhale.

Notice how your breath changes the way your body feels,

and on your next inhale, begin to count the breath. One on the inhale, and two on the exhale, three on the next inhale, and four on the next exhale, counting up to ten, and then starting over again.

If you lose track of the breath, it's okay. Just start over again, counting from one.

There is nowhere to go, nowhere to be. We are just here, counting the breath.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

And now for a moment or two, let your mind relax.

When it feels natural, let's take a nice big breath.

With each breath, allow the body to become softer and more relaxed,

almost like a wave of relaxation washing over the body.

The breath fills up the body and then it gives way to that natural relaxation that's right under the surface.

Now let's turn our awareness to how the body feels.

Just examining the body with an easy curiosity.

Allow your shoulders to relax. relax and fall away from the ears.

Relax your arms and allow your hands open and let go.

Allow your temples and face to relax.

Let the throat and the neck soften.

Allow your breath to deepen as your awareness rests. deeper,

just relaxing and releasing.

You are here and everything is okay. God is with you.

And now, for a moment or two, let go of any focus and allow yourself to simply be.

Take this verse with you. He heals the brokenhearted and bandages their wounds.

Allow your awareness to slowly come back to your body. And when it feels natural, begin to open your eyes. Sit back in your chair. Maybe you want to stretch a little bit. Do whatever feels good. Take a moment to notice how you feel. I hope you feel a little more relaxed. We'll see you again tomorrow for another day of hope.
