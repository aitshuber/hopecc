allowing the body to relax into the chair.

And again. He fills my ears with good things, and I am made young again, like the eagle.

Now. Gently bring your awareness to the breath. Allow your breath to deepen and fill the lungs.

and then exhale, controlling the breath.

Allow yourself to be here in this moment.

just relaxing and releasing.

If the thoughts take you away, that's okay. When it's easy. Bring your awareness back to the heartbeat.

Just listen to your heartbeat and the gentle sound of your breath.

Let your breath act as an anchor to this moment and this practice.

With each breath, allow yourself to rest further into the calm of God's love.

Take this verse with you. He fills my years with good things and I am made young again like the eagle.

When it feels natural, bring your awareness back to the room, just noticing the room with a gentle appreciation. And when you're ready, bring Allow your eyes to slowly open.
