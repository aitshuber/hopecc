There's a difference between being alone and being alone with God. When you're alone without God, your voice is the only voice there. But when you're alone with God, you're allowing God to speak into your heart. You're allowing yourself to be healed.

Let's start by taking a few nice, deep breaths.

As your breath begins to relax your body, allow your eyes to close like the sun sets.

Take a moment to consider this verse. For the Lord your God is living among you.

And again. For the Lord your God is living among you.

Now, bring your awareness to the space around the body.

Not really examining it, just noticing the space with an easy curiosity.

Notice any sensations on the skin.

Feel the clothes on the skin.

Feel the temperature of the room.

Listen to the sounds. In the room,

just a nice, easy focus on the sounds in the room.

Listen to the gentle sound of your breathing.

Notice the rise and the fall of the chest.

Maybe the breath is shallow, or maybe it's deep. Both are okay. Just follow the breath as it moves through your body.

Let the rhythm of your breath relax your mind.

This is a safe place. God is watching over you.

Now bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you.

Not engaging with the emotions, just noticing them with an easy curiosity.

Now take a few deep breaths. and allow the body to relax a little more with each exhale.

With each passing thought, allow your awareness to rest deeper into God's love.

Now, begin to deepen the breath.

Inhale slowly and lengthen the breath,

and then exhale, letting go of the breath,

and then right back into the next inhale.

Slow it down and make it deep, and

then exhale. Let the body relax.

Now, allow your breath to settle and let your mind settle with it.

Give yourself space just to be who you are. A child of God.

Take this verse with you. For the Lord, your God, is living among you.

When it feels easy. Bring your attention back to the feeling of the breath. Take a few more deep breaths and slowly allow your eyes to open. Notice how the breath changes the way you feel. I hope you feel a little more relaxed. We'll see you again tomorrow. Take care of yourself.
