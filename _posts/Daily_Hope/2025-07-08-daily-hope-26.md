We don't have to know the answers to all of our questions to find meaning and fulfillment. We only have to trust that there is an answer. We trust that God knows what we do not and that He has our best interest at heart. We just simply trust that God's loving hand is at work in our life. Let that sit with you.

As you go about your day, go ahead and get comfortable in your position, really allowing the body to relax.

And when you feel ready, let your eyes slowly close.

Now take a moment to consider this verse. I am with you and I will protect you everywhere you go.

Again, I am with you and I will protect you everywhere you go.

Bring your attention to any emotions you're carrying with you.

Not engaging with your feelings, just noticing them.

Almost like you're observing your emotions and then letting them go.

Just like loosening your grip, you're letting go of those feelings.

Let God handle whatever is out of your control.

This is a place of acceptance and safety. You can always Find rest in God.

Now, begin to notice how your body feels.

When it feels comfortable, begin to consciously relax the body.

Scanning down from your head to your toes, release any areas of tension in the body.

Surrender all of your stress. and all of your responsibilities, and just let your mind rest.

You are safe. God is looking out for you.

Now, bring your attention to your breath.

Just a soft, easy awareness.

Notice what it feels like as air passes in through the nose and then back out through the mouth.

Let the breath bring life to your body.

Begin to listen to the sound of your breath,

listening to the inhale and the exhale.

On the next exhale, allow the breath to relax and become natural.

Allow your breath to bring renewal to your body.

You're making space to notice God's presence in your life.

When it feels comfortable, bring your attention to the heartbeat. Allow

that rhythm and stillness to enter every part of your body.

Feel the presence of God in this space.

Let go of control and rest into the arms of God.

Take this verse with you. I am with you, and I will protect you everywhere you go. Softly,

begin to bring your awareness back to the body. Back to that feeling of weight in the body. And when you're ready, slowly open your eyes and take a big, deep breath in. Take a moment. to check in and notice how you feel. I hope you feel a little more present. We'll see you again tomorrow for another day of hope.

Take care.
