- chapter: 1
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, 
    - verse: >-
        to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
    - verse: >-
        I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day 
    - verse: >-
        longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; 
    - verse: >-
        having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also. 
    - verse: >-
        For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. 
    - verse: >-
        For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, 
    - verse: >-
        who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, 
    - verse: >-
        but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. 
    - verse: >-
        For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 
    - verse: >-
        For this cause I also suffer these things. Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. 
    - verse: >-
        Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 
    - verse: >-
        That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. 
    - verse: >-
        This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
    - verse: >-
        May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, 
    - verse: >-
        but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me 
    - verse: >-
        (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well. 
- chapter: 2
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 
    - verse: >-
        The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. 
    - verse: >-
        You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
    - verse: >-
        No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. 
    - verse: >-
        Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. 
    - verse: >-
        The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. 
    - verse: >-
        Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 
    - verse: >-
        Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring of David, according to my Good News, 
    - verse: >-
        in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 
    - verse: >-
        This saying is trustworthy: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him. 
    - verse: >-
        If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. 
    - verse: >-
        If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he can’t deny himself.” 
    - verse: >-
        Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. 
    - verse: >-
        Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. 
    - verse: >-
        But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, 
    - verse: >-
        and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: 
    - verse: >-
        men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. 
    - verse: >-
        However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.” 
    - verse: >-
        Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor. 
    - verse: >-
        If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work. 
    - verse: >-
        Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 
    - verse: >-
        But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. 
    - verse: >-
        The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient, 
    - verse: >-
        in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, 
    - verse: >-
        and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will. 
- chapter: 3
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. 
    - verse: >-
        For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 
    - verse: >-
        without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, 
    - verse: >-
        traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 
    - verse: >-
        holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. 
    - verse: >-
        For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 
    - verse: >-
        always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 
    - verse: >-
        Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. 
    - verse: >-
        But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. 
    - verse: >-
        But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, 
    - verse: >-
        persecutions, and sufferings—those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. 
    - verse: >-
        Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 
    - verse: >-
        But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 
    - verse: >-
        But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. 
    - verse: >-
        From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 
    - verse: >-
        Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, 
    - verse: >-
        that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. 
- chapter: 4
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: 
    - verse: >-
        preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. 
    - verse: >-
        For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, 
    - verse: >-
        and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. 
    - verse: >-
        But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. 
    - verse: >-
        For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. 
    - verse: >-
        I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. 
    - verse: >-
        From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. 
    - verse: >-
        Be diligent to come to me soon, 
    - verse: >-
        for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. 
    - verse: >-
        Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. 
    - verse: >-
        But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
    - verse: >-
        Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments. 
    - verse: >-
        Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. 
    - verse: >-
        Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words. 
    - verse: >-
        At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. 
    - verse: >-
        But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 
    - verse: >-
        And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 
    - verse: >-
        Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. 
    - verse: >-
        Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. 
    - verse: >-
        Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 
    - verse: >-
        The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
