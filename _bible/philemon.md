  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, 
    - verse: >-
        to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: 
    - verse: >-
        Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
    - verse: >-
        I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, 
    - verse: >-
        hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, 
    - verse: >-
        that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. 
    - verse: >-
        For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate, 
    - verse: >-
        yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. 
    - verse: >-
        I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains, 
    - verse: >-
        who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me. 
    - verse: >-
        I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, 
    - verse: >-
        whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. 
    - verse: >-
        But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will. 
    - verse: >-
        For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever, 
    - verse: >-
        no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 
    - verse: >-
        If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me. 
    - verse: >-
        But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account. 
    - verse: >-
        I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides). 
    - verse: >-
        Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord. 
    - verse: >-
        Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. 
    - verse: >-
        Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 
    - verse: >-
        Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, 
    - verse: >-
        as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 
    - verse: >-
        The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
