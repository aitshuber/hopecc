- chapter: 1
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. That man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God, and turned away from evil. 
    - verse: >-
        There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. 
    - verse: >-
        His possessions also were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east. 
    - verse: >-
        His sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 
    - verse: >-
        It was so, when the days of their feasting had run their course, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts.” Job did so continually. 
    - verse: >-
        Now on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan also came among them. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant, Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.” 
    - verse: >-
        Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? 
    - verse: >-
        Haven’t you made a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 
    - verse: >-
        But stretch out your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.” 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only on himself don’t stretch out your hand.” So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh. 
    - verse: >-
        It fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
    - verse: >-
        that a messenger came to Job, and said, “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them, 
    - verse: >-
        and the Sabeans attacked, and took them away. Yes, they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
    - verse: >-
        While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God has fallen from the sky, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
    - verse: >-
        While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans made three bands, and swept down on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
    - verse: >-
        While he was still speaking, there came also another, and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
    - verse: >-
        and behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.” 
    - verse: >-
        Then Job arose, and tore his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped. 
    - verse: >-
        He said, “Naked I came out of my mother’s womb, and naked will I return there. Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away. Blessed be Yahweh’s name.” 
    - verse: >-
        In all this, Job didn’t sin, nor charge God with wrongdoing. 
- chapter: 2
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Again, on the day when God’s sons came to present themselves before Yahweh, Satan came also among them to present himself before Yahweh. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “From going back and forth in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.” 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? For there is no one like him in the earth, a blameless and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil. He still maintains his integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause.” 
    - verse: >-
        Satan answered Yahweh, and said, “Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. 
    - verse: >-
        But stretch out your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.” 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand. Only spare his life.” 
    - verse: >-
        So Satan went out from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with painful sores from the sole of his foot to his head. 
    - verse: >-
        He took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with, and he sat among the ashes. 
    - verse: >-
        Then his wife said to him, “Do you still maintain your integrity? Renounce God, and die.” 
    - verse: >-
        But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job didn’t sin with his lips. 
    - verse: >-
        Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come on him, they each came from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him. 
    - verse: >-
        When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, and didn’t recognize him, they raised their voices, and wept; and they each tore his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky. 
    - verse: >-
        So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great. 
- chapter: 3
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth. 
    - verse: >-
        Job answered: 
    - verse: >-
        “Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’ 
    - verse: >-
        Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it. 
    - verse: >-
        Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes the day black terrify it. 
    - verse: >-
        As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein. 
    - verse: >-
        Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan. 
    - verse: >-
        Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning, 
    - verse: >-
        because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes. 
    - verse: >-
        “Why didn’t I die from the womb? Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me? 
    - verse: >-
        Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse? 
    - verse: >-
        For now I should have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest, 
    - verse: >-
        with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves; 
    - verse: >-
        or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver; 
    - verse: >-
        or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light. 
    - verse: >-
        There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest. 
    - verse: >-
        There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster. 
    - verse: >-
        The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master. 
    - verse: >-
        “Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul, 
    - verse: >-
        who long for death, but it doesn’t come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, 
    - verse: >-
        who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? 
    - verse: >-
        Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? 
    - verse: >-
        For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water. 
    - verse: >-
        For the thing which I fear comes on me, that which I am afraid of comes to me. 
    - verse: >-
        I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither do I have rest; but trouble comes.” 
- chapter: 4
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, 
    - verse: >-
        “If someone ventures to talk with you, will you be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking? 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, you have instructed many, you have strengthened the weak hands. 
    - verse: >-
        Your words have supported him who was falling, you have made the feeble knees firm. 
    - verse: >-
        But now it has come to you, and you faint. It touches you, and you are troubled. 
    - verse: >-
        Isn’t your piety your confidence? Isn’t the integrity of your ways your hope? 
    - verse: >-
        “Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off? 
    - verse: >-
        According to what I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble, reap the same. 
    - verse: >-
        By the breath of God they perish. By the blast of his anger are they consumed. 
    - verse: >-
        The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken. 
    - verse: >-
        The old lion perishes for lack of prey. The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad. 
    - verse: >-
        “Now a thing was secretly brought to me. My ear received a whisper of it. 
    - verse: >-
        In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 
    - verse: >-
        fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 
    - verse: >-
        Then a spirit passed before my face. The hair of my flesh stood up. 
    - verse: >-
        It stood still, but I couldn’t discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes. Silence, then I heard a voice, saying, 
    - verse: >-
        ‘Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, he puts no trust in his servants. He charges his angels with error. 
    - verse: >-
        How much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth! 
    - verse: >-
        Between morning and evening they are destroyed. They perish forever without any regarding it. 
    - verse: >-
        Isn’t their tent cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’ 
- chapter: 5
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        “Call now; is there any who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 
    - verse: >-
        For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple. 
    - verse: >-
        I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation. 
    - verse: >-
        His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them, 
    - verse: >-
        whose harvest the hungry eat up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance. 
    - verse: >-
        For affliction doesn’t come out of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground; 
    - verse: >-
        but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 
    - verse: >-
        “But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God, 
    - verse: >-
        who does great things that can’t be fathomed, marvelous things without number; 
    - verse: >-
        who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields; 
    - verse: >-
        so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety. 
    - verse: >-
        He frustrates the plans of the crafty, so that their hands can’t perform their enterprise. 
    - verse: >-
        He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong. 
    - verse: >-
        They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night. 
    - verse: >-
        But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty. 
    - verse: >-
        So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth. 
    - verse: >-
        “Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty. 
    - verse: >-
        For he wounds and binds up. He injures and his hands make whole. 
    - verse: >-
        He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil will touch you. 
    - verse: >-
        In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword. 
    - verse: >-
        You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes. 
    - verse: >-
        You will laugh at destruction and famine, neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth. 
    - verse: >-
        For you will be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field will be at peace with you. 
    - verse: >-
        You will know that your tent is in peace. You will visit your fold, and will miss nothing. 
    - verse: >-
        You will know also that your offspring will be great, your offspring as the grass of the earth. 
    - verse: >-
        You will come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, we have researched it. It is so. Hear it, and know it for your good.” 
- chapter: 6
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Then Job answered, 
    - verse: >-
        “Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances! 
    - verse: >-
        For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, therefore my words have been rash. 
    - verse: >-
        For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me. 
    - verse: >-
        Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder? 
    - verse: >-
        Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 
    - verse: >-
        My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me. 
    - verse: >-
        “Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing that I long for, 
    - verse: >-
        even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off! 
    - verse: >-
        Let it still be my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 
    - verse: >-
        What is my strength, that I should wait? What is my end, that I should be patient? 
    - verse: >-
        Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of bronze? 
    - verse: >-
        Isn’t it that I have no help in me, that wisdom is driven away from me? 
    - verse: >-
        “To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty. 
    - verse: >-
        My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away; 
    - verse: >-
        which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself. 
    - verse: >-
        In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place. 
    - verse: >-
        The caravans that travel beside them turn away. They go up into the waste, and perish. 
    - verse: >-
        The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them. 
    - verse: >-
        They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded. 
    - verse: >-
        For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid. 
    - verse: >-
        Did I ever say, ‘Give to me?’ or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’ 
    - verse: >-
        or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’ or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’ 
    - verse: >-
        “Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand my error. 
    - verse: >-
        How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove? 
    - verse: >-
        Do you intend to reprove words, since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind? 
    - verse: >-
        Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend. 
    - verse: >-
        Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I will not lie to your face. 
    - verse: >-
        Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous. 
    - verse: >-
        Is there injustice on my tongue? Can’t my taste discern mischievous things? 
- chapter: 7
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        “Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth? Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand? 
    - verse: >-
        As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages, 
    - verse: >-
        so I am made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me. 
    - verse: >-
        When I lie down, I say, ‘When will I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day. 
    - verse: >-
        My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh. 
    - verse: >-
        My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope. 
    - verse: >-
        Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye will no more see good. 
    - verse: >-
        The eye of him who sees me will see me no more. Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be. 
    - verse: >-
        As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more. 
    - verse: >-
        He will return no more to his house, neither will his place know him any more. 
    - verse: >-
        “Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
    - verse: >-
        Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me? 
    - verse: >-
        When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me. My couch will ease my complaint,’ 
    - verse: >-
        then you scare me with dreams and terrify me through visions, 
    - verse: >-
        so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones. 
    - verse: >-
        I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath. 
    - verse: >-
        What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him, 
    - verse: >-
        that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment? 
    - verse: >-
        How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle? 
    - verse: >-
        If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself? 
    - verse: >-
        Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now will I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I will not be.” 
- chapter: 8
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 
    - verse: >-
        “How long will you speak these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind? 
    - verse: >-
        Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness? 
    - verse: >-
        If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience. 
    - verse: >-
        If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication to the Almighty. 
    - verse: >-
        If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous. 
    - verse: >-
        Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase. 
    - verse: >-
        “Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers. 
    - verse: >-
        (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.) 
    - verse: >-
        Shall they not teach you, tell you, and utter words out of their heart? 
    - verse: >-
        “Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water? 
    - verse: >-
        While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers before any other reed. 
    - verse: >-
        So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man will perish, 
    - verse: >-
        whose confidence will break apart, whose trust is a spider’s web. 
    - verse: >-
        He will lean on his house, but it will not stand. He will cling to it, but it will not endure. 
    - verse: >-
        He is green before the sun. His shoots go out along his garden. 
    - verse: >-
        His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones. 
    - verse: >-
        If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’ 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, this is the joy of his way. Out of the earth, others will spring. 
    - verse: >-
        “Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers. 
    - verse: >-
        He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting. 
    - verse: >-
        Those who hate you will be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked will be no more.” 
- chapter: 9
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Then Job answered, 
    - verse: >-
        “Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God? 
    - verse: >-
        If he is pleased to contend with him, he can’t answer him one time in a thousand. 
    - verse: >-
        God is wise in heart, and mighty in strength. Who has hardened himself against him and prospered? 
    - verse: >-
        He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it, when he overturns them in his anger. 
    - verse: >-
        He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble. 
    - verse: >-
        He commands the sun and it doesn’t rise, and seals up the stars. 
    - verse: >-
        He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea. 
    - verse: >-
        He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south. 
    - verse: >-
        He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him. He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’ 
    - verse: >-
        “God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him. 
    - verse: >-
        How much less will I answer him, and choose my words to argue with him? 
    - verse: >-
        Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him. I would make supplication to my judge. 
    - verse: >-
        If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice. 
    - verse: >-
        For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause. 
    - verse: >-
        He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness. 
    - verse: >-
        If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’ 
    - verse: >-
        Though I am righteous, my own mouth will condemn me. Though I am blameless, it will prove me perverse. 
    - verse: >-
        I am blameless. I don’t respect myself. I despise my life. 
    - verse: >-
        “It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked. 
    - verse: >-
        If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent. 
    - verse: >-
        The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it? 
    - verse: >-
        “Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away. They see no good. 
    - verse: >-
        They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey. 
    - verse: >-
        If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up,’ 
    - verse: >-
        I am afraid of all my sorrows. I know that you will not hold me innocent. 
    - verse: >-
        I will be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain? 
    - verse: >-
        If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye, 
    - verse: >-
        yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes will abhor me. 
    - verse: >-
        For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment. 
    - verse: >-
        There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both. 
    - verse: >-
        Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid; 
    - verse: >-
        then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself. 
- chapter: 10
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        “My soul is weary of my life. I will give free course to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
    - verse: >-
        I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me. Show me why you contend with me. 
    - verse: >-
        Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile on the counsel of the wicked? 
    - verse: >-
        Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as man sees? 
    - verse: >-
        Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man’s years, 
    - verse: >-
        that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin? 
    - verse: >-
        Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can deliver out of your hand. 
    - verse: >-
        “‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether, yet you destroy me.

        Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay. Will you bring me into dust again? 
    - verse: >-
        Haven’t you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese? 
    - verse: >-
        You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. 
    - verse: >-
        You have granted me life and loving kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit. 
    - verse: >-
        Yet you hid these things in your heart. I know that this is with you: 
    - verse: >-
        if I sin, then you mark me. You will not acquit me from my iniquity. 
    - verse: >-
        If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am righteous, I still will not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious of my affliction. 
    - verse: >-
        If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion. Again you show yourself powerful to me. 
    - verse: >-
        You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me. Changes and warfare are with me. 
    - verse: >-
        “‘Why, then, have you brought me out of the womb? I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me.

        Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered, 
    - verse: >-
        “Shouldn’t the multitude of words be answered? Should a man full of talk be justified? 
    - verse: >-
        Should your boastings make men hold their peace? When you mock, will no man make you ashamed?

    - verse: >-
        But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you, 
    - verse: >-
        that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For true wisdom has two sides. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves. 
    - verse: >-
        “Can you fathom the mystery of God? Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty? 
    - verse: >-
        They are high as heaven. What can you do? They are deeper than Sheol. What can you know?

    - verse: >-
        If he passes by, or confines, or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?

        An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey’s colt. 
    - verse: >-
        “If you set your heart aright, stretch out your hands toward him.

    - verse: >-
        for you will forget your misery. You will remember it like waters that have passed away. 
    - verse: >-
        Life will be clearer than the noonday. Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning. 
    - verse: >-
        You will be secure, because there is hope. Yes, you will search, and will take your rest in safety.

    - verse: >-
        I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke. 
    - verse: >-
        In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.

        Who doesn’t know that in all these, Yahweh’s hand has done this, 
    - verse: >-
        in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind? 
    - verse: >-
        Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food? 
    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        “With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding. 
    - verse: >-

        Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth. 
    - verse: >-
        With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his. 
    - verse: >-
        He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools. 
    - verse: >-
        He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt. 
    - verse: >-
        He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty. 
    - verse: >-
        He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders. 
    - verse: >-
        He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong. 
    - verse: >-
        He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death. 
    - verse: >-
        He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive. 
    - verse: >-
        He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.

        “Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God. 
    - verse: >-
        But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value. 
    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips. 
    - verse: >-
        Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him? 
    - verse: >-
        Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God? 
    - verse: >-
        Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him? 
    - verse: >-
        He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality. 
    - verse: >-
        Won’t his majesty make you afraid and his dread fall on you? 
    - verse: >-
        Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes. Your defenses are defenses of clay. 
    - verse: >-
        “Be silent! Leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will. 
    - verse: >-
        Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?

        Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him. 
    - verse: >-
        This also will be my salvation, that a godless man will not come before him.

        See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous. 
    - verse: >-
        Who is he who will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.

    - verse: >-
        Then call, and I will answer, or let me speak, and you answer me. 
    - verse: >-
        How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin. 
    - verse: >-
        Why do you hide your face, and consider me your enemy? 
    - verse: >-
        Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble? 
    - verse: >-
        For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 
    - verse: >-
        You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet,

        Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with you? 
    - verse: >-
        Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one. 
    - verse: >-
        Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass. 
    - verse: >-
        Look away from him, that he may rest, until he accomplishes, as a hireling, his day. 
    - verse: >-
        “For there is hope for a tree if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease. 
    - verse: >-
        Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies in the ground, 
    - verse: >-
        yet through the scent of water it will bud, and sprout boughs like a plant. 
    - verse: >-
        But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he? 
    - verse: >-

        If a man dies, will he live again? I would wait all the days of my warfare, until my release should come. 
    - verse: >-
        You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire for the work of your hands. 
    - verse: >-
        But now you count my steps. Don’t you watch over my sin? 
    - verse: >-
        My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity.

        The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man. 
    - verse: >-
        You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away. 
    - verse: >-
        His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it. They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them.

        Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God. 
    - verse: >-
        For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.

        Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you? 
    - verse: >-
        Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,

        that you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth? 
    - verse: >-
        What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?

        A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer will come on him. 
    - verse: >-
        He doesn’t believe that he will return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword. 
    - verse: >-
        He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
    - verse: >-
        Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle. 
    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers, 
    - verse: >-
        because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs. 
    - verse: >-
        He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps. 
    - verse: >-
        He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue, neither will their possessions be extended on the earth. 
    - verse: >-
        He will not depart out of darkness. The flame will dry up his branches. He will go away by the breath of God’s mouth. 
    - verse: >-
        Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his reward. 
    - verse: >-
        It will be accomplished before his time. His branch will not be green. 
    - verse: >-
        He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and will cast off his flower as the olive tree. 
    - verse: >-
        For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.

    - verse: >-
        God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked. 
    - verse: >-
        I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his target. 
    - verse: >-
        His archers surround me. He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my bile on the ground. 
    - verse: >-
        He breaks me with breach on breach. He runs at me like a giant. 
    - verse: >-
        I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn in the dust.

    - verse: >-
        Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
    - verse: >-
        Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were older than he. 
    - verse: >-
        When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.

        Yes, I gave you my full attention, but there was no one who convinced Job, or who answered his words, among you. 
    - verse: >-
        Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom. God may refute him, not man;’

    - verse: >-
        Shall I wait, because they don’t speak, because they stand still, and answer no more? 
    - verse: >-
        I also will answer my part, and I also will show my opinion. 
    - verse: >-
        For I am full of words. The spirit within me constrains me.

        Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent; like new wineskins it is ready to burst. 
    - verse: >-
        I will speak, that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer. 
    - verse: >-
        Please don’t let me respect any man’s person, neither will I give flattering titles to any man.

    - verse: >-
        that he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man. 
    - verse: >-
        He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword. 
    - verse: >-
        “He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones, 
    - verse: >-
        so that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food. 
    - verse: >-
        His flesh is so consumed away that it can’t be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out. 
    - verse: >-
        Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers. 
    - verse: >-
        “If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him, 
    - verse: >-
        then God is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’ 
    - verse: >-
        His flesh will be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth. 
    - verse: >-
        He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness. 
    - verse: >-
        He sings before men, and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn’t profit me. 
    - verse: >-
        He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life will see the light.’ 
    - verse: >-
        “Behold, God does all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man, 
    - verse: >-
        to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living. 
    - verse: >-
        Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak. 
    - verse: >-
        If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you. 
    - verse: >-
        If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”

        Moreover Elihu answered, 
    - verse: >-
        “Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to me, you who have knowledge. 
    - verse: >-
        For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food. 
    - verse: >-
        Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good. 
    - verse: >-
        For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, God has taken away my right. 
    - verse: >-
        Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’ 
    - verse: >-
        What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water, 
    - verse: >-
        who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men? 
    - verse: >-
        For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.’ 
    - verse: >-
        “Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity. 
    - verse: >-
        For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. 
    - verse: >-
        Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice. 
    - verse: >-
        Who put him in charge of the earth? Or who has appointed him over the whole world? 
    - verse: >-
        If he set his heart on himself, if he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath, 
    - verse: >-
        all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust. 
    - verse: >-
        “If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words. 
    - verse: >-
        Should even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty, 
    - verse: >-
        who says to a king, ‘Vile!’ or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’? 
    - verse: >-
        He doesn’t respect the persons of princes, nor respect the rich more than the poor, for they all are the work of his hands. 
    - verse: >-
        In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand. 
    - verse: >-
        “For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings. 
    - verse: >-
        There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves. 
    - verse: >-
        For he doesn’t need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment. 
    - verse: >-
        He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed. 
    - verse: >-
        He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 
    - verse: >-
        because they turned away from following him, and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways, 
    - verse: >-
        so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted. 
    - verse: >-
        When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? He is over a nation or a man alike, 
    - verse: >-
        that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people. 
    - verse: >-
        “For has any said to God, ‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more. 
    - verse: >-
        Teach me that which I don’t see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’? 
    - verse: >-
        Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know. 
    - verse: >-
        Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me: 
    - verse: >-
        ‘Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.’ 
    - verse: >-
        I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men. 
    - verse: >-
        For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.” 
- chapter: 35
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Moreover Elihu answered, 
    - verse: >-
        “Do you think this to be your right, or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’ 
    - verse: >-
        that you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you? What profit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’ 
    - verse: >-
        I will answer you, and your companions with you. 
    - verse: >-
        Look to the skies, and see. See the skies, which are higher than you. 
    - verse: >-
        If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? 
    - verse: >-
        If you are righteous, what do you give him? Or what does he receive from your hand? 
    - verse: >-
        Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness may profit a son of man. 
    - verse: >-
        “By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
    - verse: >-
        But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, 
    - verse: >-
        who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’ 
    - verse: >-
        There they cry, but no one answers, because of the pride of evil men. 
    - verse: >-
        Surely God will not hear an empty cry, neither will the Almighty regard it. 
    - verse: >-
        How much less when you say you don’t see him. The cause is before him, and you wait for him! 
    - verse: >-
        But now, because he has not visited in his anger, neither does he greatly regard arrogance, 
    - verse: >-
        therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies words without knowledge.” 
- chapter: 36
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Elihu also continued, and said, 
    - verse: >-
        “Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still have something to say on God’s behalf. 
    - verse: >-
        I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 
    - verse: >-
        For truly my words are not false. One who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 
    - verse: >-
        “Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding. 
    - verse: >-
        He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the afflicted. 
    - verse: >-
        He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted. 
    - verse: >-
        If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the cords of afflictions, 
    - verse: >-
        then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly. 
    - verse: >-
        He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity. 
    - verse: >-
        If they listen and serve him, they will spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 
    - verse: >-
        But if they don’t listen, they will perish by the sword; they will die without knowledge. 
    - verse: >-
        “But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They don’t cry for help when he binds them. 
    - verse: >-
        They die in youth. Their life perishes among the unclean. 
    - verse: >-
        He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression. 
    - verse: >-
        Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a wide place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness. 
    - verse: >-
        “But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside. 
    - verse: >-
        Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might of your strength? 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t desire the night, when people are cut off in their place. 
    - verse: >-
        Take heed, don’t regard iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him? 
    - verse: >-
        Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’ 
    - verse: >-
        “Remember that you magnify his work, about which men have sung. 
    - verse: >-
        All men have looked on it. Man sees it afar off. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him. The number of his years is unsearchable. 
    - verse: >-
        For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain from his vapor, 
    - verse: >-
        which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly. 
    - verse: >-
        Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds and the thunderings of his pavilion? 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, he spreads his light around him. He covers the bottom of the sea. 
    - verse: >-
        For by these he judges the people. He gives food in abundance. 
    - verse: >-
        He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark. 
    - verse: >-
        Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also, concerning the storm that comes up. 
- chapter: 37
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        “Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place. 
    - verse: >-
        Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes out of his mouth. 
    - verse: >-
        He sends it out under the whole sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth. 
    - verse: >-
        After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of his majesty. He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard. 
    - verse: >-
        God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things, which we can’t comprehend. 
    - verse: >-
        For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain. 
    - verse: >-
        He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know it. 
    - verse: >-
        Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens. 
    - verse: >-
        Out of its room comes the storm, and cold out of the north. 
    - verse: >-
        By the breath of God, ice is given, and the width of the waters is frozen. 
    - verse: >-
        Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning. 
    - verse: >-
        It is turned around by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world, 
    - verse: >-
        whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come. 
    - verse: >-
        “Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God. 
    - verse: >-
        Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine? 
    - verse: >-
        Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge? 
    - verse: >-
        You whose clothing is warm when the earth is still by reason of the south wind? 
    - verse: >-
        Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a cast metal mirror? 
    - verse: >-
        Teach us what we will tell him, for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness. 
    - verse: >-
        Will it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up? 
    - verse: >-
        Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them. 
    - verse: >-
        Out of the north comes golden splendor. With God is awesome majesty. 
    - verse: >-
        We can’t reach the Almighty. He is exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress.

    - verse: >-
        What were its foundations fastened on? Or who laid its cornerstone,

        when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 
    - verse: >-
        “Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke out of the womb, 
    - verse: >-
        when I made clouds its garment, and wrapped it in thick darkness, 
    - verse: >-
        marked out for it my bound, set bars and doors,

    - verse: >-
        that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and shake the wicked out of it? 
    - verse: >-
        It is changed as clay under the seal, and presented as a garment. 
    - verse: >-
        From the wicked, their light is withheld. The high arm is broken.

        “I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be restrained. 
    - verse: >-
        You asked, ‘Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?’ therefore I have uttered that which I didn’t understand, things too wonderful for me, which I didn’t know.

        It was so, that after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.

        Now therefore, take to yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept him, that I not deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.”
