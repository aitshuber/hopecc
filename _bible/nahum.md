    - verse: >-
        A revelation about Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges. Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath. Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he maintains wrath against his enemies. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. 
    - verse: >-
        He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel languish. The flower of Lebanon languishes.

        Who can stand before his indignation? Who can endure the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.

        But with an overflowing flood, he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness. 
    - verse: >-
        What do you plot against Yahweh? He will make a full end. Affliction won’t rise up the second time. 
    - verse: >-
        For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly like dry stubble. 
    - verse: >-
        One has gone out of you who devises evil against Yahweh, who counsels wickedness. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh says: “Though they are in full strength and likewise many, even so they will be cut down and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more. 
    - verse: >-
        Now I will break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds apart.” 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh has commanded concerning you: “No more descendants will bear your name. Out of the house of your gods, I will cut off the engraved image and the molten image. I will make your grave, for you are vile.” 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace! Keep your feasts, Judah! Perform your vows, for the wicked one will no more pass through you. He is utterly cut off.

    - verse: >-
        For Yahweh restores the excellency of Jacob as the excellency of Israel, for the destroyers have destroyed them and ruined their vine branches.

        The shield of his mighty men is made red. The valiant men are in scarlet. The chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the pine spears are brandished. 
    - verse: >-
        The chariots rage in the streets. They rush back and forth in the wide ways. Their appearance is like torches. They run like the lightnings. 
    - verse: >-
        He summons his picked troops. They stumble on their way. They dash to its wall, and the protective shield is put in place. 
    - verse: >-
        The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved. 
    - verse: >-
        It is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her servants moan as with the voice of doves, beating on their breasts. 
    - verse: >-
        But Nineveh has been from of old like a pool of water, yet they flee away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one looks back. 
    - verse: >-
        Take the plunder of silver. Take the plunder of gold, for there is no end of treasure, an abundance of every precious thing.

        She is empty, void, and waste. The heart melts, the knees knock together, their bodies and faces have grown pale.

        Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked with the lion’s cubs, and no one made them afraid?

        The lion tore in pieces enough for his cubs, and strangled prey for his lionesses, and filled his caves with the kill and his dens with prey. 
    - verse: >-
        “Behold, I am against you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword will devour your young lions; and I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard.”

        The noise of the whip, the noise of the rattling of wheels, prancing horses, and bounding chariots, 
    - verse: >-
        the horseman charging, and the flashing sword, the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of corpses, and there is no end of the bodies. They stumble on their bodies 
    - verse: >-
        because of the multitude of the prostitution of the alluring prostitute, the mistress of witchcraft, who sells nations through her prostitution, and families through her witchcraft. 
    - verse: >-
        “Behold, I am against you,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I will lift your skirts over your face. I will show the nations your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame.

        Are you better than No-Amon, who was situated among the rivers, who had the waters around her, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?

        Cush and Egypt were her boundless strength. Put and Libya were her helpers.

        Draw water for the siege. Strengthen your fortresses. Go into the clay, and tread the mortar. Make the brick kiln strong. 
    - verse: >-
        There the fire will devour you. The sword will cut you off. It will devour you like the grasshopper. Multiply like grasshoppers. Multiply like the locust. 
    - verse: >-
        You have increased your merchants more than the stars of the skies. The grasshopper strips and flees away. 
    - verse: >-
        Your guards are like the locusts, and your officials like the swarms of locusts, which settle on the walls on a cold day, but when the sun appears, they flee away, and their place is not known where they are. 
    - verse: >-
        Your shepherds slumber, king of Assyria. Your nobles lie down. Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them.
