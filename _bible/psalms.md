        Serve Yahweh with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

        Yahweh, in the morning you will hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.

        Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness’ sake. 
    - verse: >-
        For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?

    - verse: >-
        lest they tear apart my soul like a lion, ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh, my God, if I have done this, if there is iniquity in my hands, 
    - verse: >-
        if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),

        Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me.

        The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on the crown of his own head.

        He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble.” 
    - verse: >-
        His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.

        Why does the wicked person condemn God, and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”

        But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless. 
    - verse: >-
        Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh is King forever and ever! The nations will perish out of his land. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,

    - verse: >-
        Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double heart. 
    - verse: >-
        May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts, 
    - verse: >-
        who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?”

    - verse: >-
        Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death; 
    - verse: >-

- chapter: 14
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        For the Chief Musician. By David. The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds. There is no one who does good. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any who understood, who sought after God. 
    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        he who doesn’t slander with his tongue, nor does evil to his friend, nor casts slurs against his fellow man; 
    - verse: >-
        in whose eyes a vile man is despised, but who honors those who fear Yahweh; he who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;

    - verse: >-
        that they might set their hope in God, and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his commandments,

    - verse: >-
        He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.

    - verse: >-
        They tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire.

        Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness? 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?” 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel, 
    - verse: >-
        because they didn’t believe in God, and didn’t trust in his salvation. 
    - verse: >-

        Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.

    - verse: >-
        He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations. 
    - verse: >-
        So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire. 
    - verse: >-
        They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths, 
    - verse: >-
        when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of their strongest, and struck down the young men of Israel. 
    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.

        They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer. 
    - verse: >-
        But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue. 
    - verse: >-
        For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in his covenant. 
    - verse: >-
        But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath. 
    - verse: >-
        He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again. 
    - verse: >-
        How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and grieved him in the desert! 
    - verse: >-
        They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
    - verse: >-
        They didn’t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary; 
    - verse: >-
        how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan, 
    - verse: >-
        he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, so that they could not drink. 
    - verse: >-
        He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 
    - verse: >-
        He also gave their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor to the locust. 
    - verse: >-
        He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig trees with frost. 
    - verse: >-
        He also gave over their livestock to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
    - verse: >-
        He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of angels of evil. 
    - verse: >-
        He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence, 
    - verse: >-
        and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham. 
    - verse: >-
        But he led out his own people like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
    - verse: >-
        He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
    - verse: >-
        He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken. 
    - verse: >-
        He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. 
    - verse: >-
        Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t keep his testimonies, 
    - verse: >-
        but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a deceitful bow. 
    - verse: >-
        For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images. 
    - verse: >-
        When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel, 
    - verse: >-
        so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men, 
    - verse: >-
        and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the adversary’s hand. 
    - verse: >-
        He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance. 
    - verse: >-
        Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song. 
    - verse: >-
        Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep. 
    - verse: >-
        Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. 
    - verse: >-
        He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach. 
    - verse: >-
        Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim, 
    - verse: >-
        But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved. 
    - verse: >-
        He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has established forever. 
    - verse: >-
        He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds; 
    - verse: >-
        from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance. 
    - verse: >-
        So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

    - verse: >-
        They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem. There was no one to bury them. 
    - verse: >-
        We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those who are around us. 
    - verse: >-
        How long, Yahweh? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? 
    - verse: >-
        Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you, on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name, 
    - verse: >-
        for they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us. Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are in desperate need.
