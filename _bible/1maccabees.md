    - verse: >-
        After Alexander the Macedonian, the son of Philip, who came out of the land of Chittim, and struck Darius king of the Persians and Medes, it came to pass, after he had struck him, that he reigned in his place, in former time, over Greece.

        He fought many battles, won many strongholds, killed the kings of the earth, 
    - verse: >-
        went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils of a multitude of nations. The earth was quiet before him. He was exalted. His heart was lifted up.

    - verse: >-
        There came out of them a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the one hundred thirty seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks. 
    - verse: >-
        In those days transgressors of the law came out of Israel and persuaded many, saying, let’s go make a covenant with the Gentiles around us; for since we were separated from them many evils have befallen us. 
    - verse: >-
        That proposal was good in their eyes. 
    - verse: >-
        Some of the people eagerly went to the king, and he authorized them to observe the ordinances of the Gentiles.

        So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem according to the laws of the Gentiles.

        He entered into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, with elephants, with cavalry, and with a great navy.

        and entered presumptuously into the sanctuary, and took the golden altar, the lampstand for the light, and all its utensils. 
    - verse: >-
        He took the table of the show bread, the cups for the drink offerings, the bowls, the golden censers, the veil, the crowns, and the gold decoration on the front of the temple. He peeled it all off. 
    - verse: >-
        He took the silver, the gold, and the precious vessels. He took the hidden treasures which he found. 
    - verse: >-
        When he had taken all of these, he went away into his own land. He made a great slaughter, and spoke very arrogantly. 
    - verse: >-
        Great mourning came upon Israel, in every place where they were. 
    - verse: >-
        The rulers and elders groaned. The virgins and young men were made feeble. The beauty of the women was changed.

        After two full years, the king sent a chief collector of tribute to the cities of Judah, and he came to Jerusalem with a great multitude. 
    - verse: >-
        He spoke words of peace to them in subtlety, and they believed him. Then he fell upon the city suddenly, struck it very severely, and destroyed many people of Israel.

    - verse: >-
        They stored up weapons and food, and gathering together the spoils of Jerusalem, they stored them there, and they became a great menace. 
    - verse: >-
        It became a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, and an evil adversary to Israel continually. 
    - verse: >-
        They shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary, and defiled the sanctuary. 
    - verse: >-
        The inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because of them. She became a habitation of foreigners. She became foreign to those who were born in her, and her children forsook her. 
    - verse: >-
        Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feasts were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths into reproach, and her honor into contempt. 
    - verse: >-
        According to her glory, so was her dishonor multiplied, and her exaltation was turned into mourning. 
    - verse: >-
        King Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom that all should be one people, 
    - verse: >-
        and that each should forsake his own laws. All the nations agreed according to the word of the king. 
    - verse: >-
        Many of Israel consented to his worship, sacrificed to the idols, and profaned the Sabbath. 
    - verse: >-
        The king sent letters by the hand of messengers to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, that they should follow laws strange to the land, 
    - verse: >-
        and should forbid whole burnt offerings and sacrifice and drink offerings in the sanctuary; and should profane the Sabbaths and feasts, 
    - verse: >-
        and pollute the sanctuary and those who were holy; 
    - verse: >-
        that they should build altars, and temples, and shrines for idols, and should sacrifice swine’s flesh and unclean animals; 
    - verse: >-
        and that they should leave their sons uncircumcised, that they should make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation; 
    - verse: >-
        so that they might forget the law, and change all the ordinances. 
    - verse: >-
        Whoever doesn’t do according to the word of the king, he shall die.

        According to all these words wrote he to his whole kingdom. He appointed overseers over all the people, and he commanded the cities of Judah to sacrifice, city by city. 
    - verse: >-
        From the people were gathered together to them many, everyone who had forsaken the law; and they did evil things in the land.

        They tore the books of the law which they found in pieces and set them on fire.

        Anyone who was found with any a book of the covenant, and if any consented to the law, the king’s sentence delivered him to death.

        Thus did they in their might to Israel, to those who were found month by month in the cities.

  verses:
    - verse: >-
        In those days Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem rose up; and he lived at Modin. 
    - verse: >-
        And he had five sons: John, who was surnamed Gaddis;

        Judas, who was called Maccabaeus;

    - verse: >-
        He saw the blasphemies that were committed in Judah and in Jerusalem, 
    - verse: >-
        and he said, “Woe is me! Why was I born to see the destruction of my people and the destruction of the holy city, and to dwell there when it was given into the hand of the enemy, the sanctuary into the hand of foreigners? 
    - verse: >-
        Her temple has become like a man who was glorious. 
    - verse: >-
        Her vessels of glory are carried away into captivity. Her infants are slain in her streets. Her young men are slain with the enemy’s sword. 
    - verse: >-
        What nation has not inherited her palaces and taken possession of her spoils? 
    - verse: >-
        Her adornment has all been taken away. Instead of a free woman, she has become a slave.

        Behold, our holy things, our beauty, and our glory are laid waste. The Gentiles have profaned them. 
    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        Mattathias and his sons tore their clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned exceedingly. 
    - verse: >-
        And the king’s officers who were enforcing the apostasy came into the city Modin to sacrifice. 
    - verse: >-
        Many of Israel came to them, and Mattathias and his sons were gathered together. 
    - verse: >-
        The king’s officers answered and spoke to Mattathias, saying, “You are a ruler and an honorable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and kindred. 
    - verse: >-
        Now therefore come first and do the commandment of the king, as all the nations have done, including the men of Judah and those who remain in Jerusalem. You and your house will be numbered among the king’s friends, and you and your sons will be honored with silver and gold and many gifts.” 
    - verse: >-
        And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice, “If all the nations that are in the house of the king’s dominion listen to him, to fall away each one from the worship of his fathers, and have made choice to follow his commandments, 
    - verse: >-
        yet I and my sons and my kindred will walk in the covenant of our fathers. 
    - verse: >-
        Far be it from us that we should forsake the law and the ordinances. 
    - verse: >-
        We will not listen to the king’s words, to turn aside from our worship, to the right hand, or to the left.” 
    - verse: >-
        When he had finished speaking these words, a Jew came in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king’s commandment. 
    - verse: >-
        Mattathias saw it, so his zeal was kindled, and his guts trembled, and he vented his wrath according to judgment, and ran and killed him upon the altar. 
    - verse: >-
        He killed the king’s officer, who compelled men to sacrifice, at the same time, and pulled down the altar. 
    - verse: >-
        He was zealous for the law, even as Phinehas did to Zimri the son of Salu. 
    - verse: >-
        Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying, “Whoever is zealous for the law and maintains the covenant, let him follow me!” 
    - verse: >-
        He and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that they had in the city. 
    - verse: >-
        Then many who sought justice and judgment went down into the wilderness to live there— 
    - verse: >-
        they, their children, their wives, and their livestock—because evils were multiplied upon them. 
    - verse: >-
        It was told the king’s officers and the forces that were in Jerusalem, the city of David, that certain men who had broken the king’s commandment had gone down into the secret places in the wilderness; 
    - verse: >-
        and many pursued after them, and having overtaken them, they encamped against them and set the battle in array against them on the Sabbath day. 
    - verse: >-
        They said to them, “Enough of this! Come out and do according to the word of the king, and you will all live!” 
    - verse: >-
        They said, “We won’t come out. We won’t do the word of the king, to profane the Sabbath day.” 
    - verse: >-
        Then the enemy hurried to attack them. 
    - verse: >-
        They didn’t answer them. They didn’t cast a stone at them, or block their secret places, 
    - verse: >-
        saying, “Let’s all die in our innocence. Heaven and earth testify for us, that you put us to death unjustly.” 
    - verse: >-
        So they attacked them on the Sabbath, and they died—they, their wives, their children, and their livestock—in number a thousand souls of men. 
    - verse: >-
        When Mattathias and his friends found out about it, and they mourned over them exceedingly. 
    - verse: >-
        One said to another, “If we all do as our kindred have done, and don’t fight against the Gentiles for our lives and our ordinances, they will quickly destroy us from off the earth.” 
    - verse: >-
        So they decided that day, saying, “Whoever comes against us to battle on the Sabbath day, let’s fight against him, and we will in no way all die, as our kindred died in the secret places.” 
    - verse: >-
        Then a company of the Hasidaeans, mighty men of Israel, everyone who offered himself willingly for the law, were gathered together to them. 
    - verse: >-
        All those who fled from the evils were added to them, and supported them. 
    - verse: >-
        They mustered an army, and struck sinners in their anger, and lawless men in their wrath. The rest fled to the Gentiles for safety. 
    - verse: >-
        And Mattathias and his friends went around and pulled down the altars. 
    - verse: >-
        They forcibly circumcised the boys who were uncircumcised, as many as they found in the coasts of Israel. 
    - verse: >-
        They pursued the arrogant, and the work prospered in their hand. 
    - verse: >-
        They rescued the law out of the hand of the Gentiles and out of the hand of the kings. They never allowed the sinner to triumph. 
    - verse: >-
        The days of Mattathias drew near that he should die, and he said to his sons, “Now pride and scorn have gained strength. It is a season of overthrow and indignant wrath. 
    - verse: >-
        Now, my children, be zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers. 
    - verse: >-
        Call to remembrance the deeds of our fathers which they did in their generations; and receive great glory and an everlasting name.

    - verse: >-
        Don’t be afraid of the words of a sinful man; for his glory will be dung and worms. 
    - verse: >-
        Today he will be lifted up, and tomorrow he will in no way be found, because he has returned to dust, and his thought has perished. 
    - verse: >-
        You, my children, be strong, and show yourselves men on behalf of the law; for in it you will obtain glory. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, Simon your brother, whom I know to be a man of counsel. Always listen to him. He shall be a father to you.

    - verse: >-
        Repay the Gentiles, and obey the commandments of the law.” 
    - verse: >-
        He blessed them, and was gathered to his ancestors. 
    - verse: >-
        He died in the one hundred forty sixth year, and his sons buried him in the tombs of his ancestors at Modin. All Israel made great lamentation for him.

    - verse: >-
        Hem in this army in the hand of your people Israel, and let them be ashamed for their army and their cavalry. 
    - verse: >-
        Give them faintness of heart. Cause the boldness of their strength to melt away, and let them quake at their destruction.

        They offered the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, that they might prepare them for the battle.

        Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass, the mountains lit up, and blazed like flaming torches.

        Eleazar, who was called Avaran, saw one of the animals armed with royal breastplates, and it was taller than all the animals, and the king seemed to be on it. 
    - verse: >-
        He gave his life to deliver his people, and to get himself an everlasting name. 
    - verse: >-
        He ran upon him courageously into the midst of the phalanx, and killed on the right hand and on the left, and they parted away from him on this side and on that. 
    - verse: >-
        He crept under the elephant, and stabbed it from beneath, and killed it. The elephant fell to the earth upon him, and he died there.

        He made peace with the people of Bethsura. He came out of the city because they had no food there to endure the siege, because it was a Sabbath to the land. 
    - verse: >-
        The king took Bethsura, and appointed a garrison there to keep it.

        The Jews also made engines of war against their engines, and fought for many days. 
    - verse: >-
        But there was no food in the sanctuary, because it was the seventh year, and those who fled for safety into Judea from among the Gentiles had eaten up the rest of the stores. 
    - verse: >-
        There were only a few people left in the sanctuary, because the famine prevailed against them, and they were scattered, each man to his own place.

    - verse: >-
        He made haste, and gave orders to depart. He said to the king and the leaders of the army and to the men, “We get weaker daily, our food is scant, the place where we encamp is strong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us. 
    - verse: >-
        Now therefore let’s negotiate with these men, and make peace with them and with all their nation,

        and covenant with them, that they may walk after their own laws, as before; for because of their laws which we abolished they were angered, and did all these things.” 
    - verse: >-
        The speech pleased the king and the princes, and he sent to them to make peace; and they accepted it. 
    - verse: >-
        The king and the princes swore to them. On these conditions, they came out from the stronghold. 
    - verse: >-
        Then the king entered into mount Zion. He saw the strength of the place, and broke the oath which he had sworn, and gave orders to pull down the wall all around. 
    - verse: >-
        Then he left in haste and returned to Antioch, and found Philip master of the city. He fought against him, and took the city by force.

    - verse: >-
        Now therefore send a man whom you trust, and let him go and see all the destruction which he has brought on us and the king’s country, and how he has punished them and all who helped them.” 
    - verse: >-

        The Hasidaeans were the first among the children of Israel who sought peace from them,

        He spoke with them words of peace, and swore to them, saying, “We won’t seek to harm you or your friends.” 
    - verse: >-
        They trusted him. Then he seized sixty men of them, and killed them in one day, according to the word which was written, 
    - verse: >-
        The flesh of your saints and their blood was shed all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them. 
    - verse: >-
        The fear and the dread of them fell upon all the people, for they said, “There is neither truth nor justice in them; for they have broken the covenant and the oath which they swore.” 
    - verse: >-
        Bacchides withdrew from Jerusalem, and encamped in Bezeth. He sent and seized many of the deserters who were with him, and some of the people, and he killed them, throwing them into a large pit.

    - verse: >-
        He came to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. The enemies were ready to seize Judas by violence.

    - verse: >-
        After these things, Nicanor went up to mount Zion. Some of the priests came out of the sanctuary, with some of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to show him the whole burned sacrifice that was being offered for the king. 
    - verse: >-
        He mocked them, laughed at them, derided them shamefully, spoke arrogantly, 
    - verse: >-
        and swore in a rage, saying, “Unless Judas and his army are now delivered into my hands, it shall be that, if I return safely, I will burn up this house!” And he went out in a great rage. 
    - verse: >-
        The priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple; and they wept, and said, 
    - verse: >-
        “You chose this house to be called by your name, to be a house of prayer and supplication for your people.

        Take vengeance on this man and his army, and let them fall by the sword. Remember their blasphemies, and don’t allow them to live any longer.”

        Even so, crush this army before us today, and let all the rest know that he has spoken wickedly against your sanctuary. Judge him according to his wickedness.”

    - verse: >-
        They pursued them a day’s journey from Adasa until you come to Gazara, and they sounded an alarm after them with the signal trumpets. 
    - verse: >-
        Men came out of all the surrounding villages of Judea, and outflanked them. These turned them back on those, and they all fell by the sword. There wasn’t one of them left. 
    - verse: >-
        The Jews took the spoils and the booty, and they cut off Nicanor’s head and his right hand, which he had stretched out so arrogantly, and brought them, and hung them up beside Jerusalem.

        The people were exceedingly glad, and they kept that day as a day of great gladness.

        and what things they did in the land of Spain, that they might take control of the silver and gold mines which were there;

        The remaining kingdoms and islands, as many as rose up against them at any time, they destroyed and made them to be their servants;

        but with their friends and those who relied on them they stayed friends. They conquered the kingdoms that were near and those that were far off, and all that heard of their fame were afraid of them. 
    - verse: >-
        Moreover, whoever they desired to help and to make kings, these they make kings; and whoever they desired, they depose. They are exalted exceedingly.

    - verse: >-
        and that they should free the yoke from themselves; for they saw that the kingdom of the Greeks kept Israel in bondage. 
    - verse: >-
        Then they went to Rome, a very long journey, and they entered into the senate house, and said, 
    - verse: >-
        “Judas, who is also called Maccabaeus, and his kindred, and the people of the Jews, have sent us to you, to make an alliance and peace with you, and that we might be registered as your allies and friends.”

    - verse: >-
        To those who make war upon them, they shall not give supplies, food, weapons, money, or ships, as it has seemed good to Rome, and they shall keep their ordinances without taking anything in return.

        According to these terms, the Romans made a treaty with the Jewish people.

        He said to those who were left, “Let’s arise and go up against our adversaries, if perhaps we may be able to fight with them.” 
    - verse: >-
        They tried to dissuade him, saying, “There is no way we are able; but let’s rather save our lives now. Let’s return again with our kindred, and fight against them; but we are too few.” 
    - verse: >-
        Judas said, “Let it not be so that I should do this thing, to flee from them. If our time has come, let’s die in a manly way for our kindred’s sake, and not leave a cause of reproach against our honor.”

        Now therefore cry to heaven, that you may be delivered out of the hand of your enemies.” 
    - verse: >-

        Alcimus died at that time with great torment.

        He struck Odomera and his kindred, and the children of Phasiron in their tents.

    - verse: >-
        and fought against Bacchides, and he was defeated by them. They afflicted him severely; for his counsel and expedition was in vain. 
    - verse: >-
        They were very angry with the lawless men who gave him counsel to come into the country, and they killed many of them. Then he decided to depart into his own land.

    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        Now we have appointed you this day to be high priest of your nation, and to be called the king’s friend, and to take our side, and to keep friendship with us.” He also sent to him a purple robe and a golden crown.

    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        Besides this, the five thousand shekels of silver which they received from the uses of the sanctuary from the revenue year by year is also released, because it belongs to the priests who minister there. 
    - verse: >-
        Whoever flees to the temple that is at Jerusalem, and within all of its borders, whether one owe money to the king, or any other matter, let them go free, along with all that they have in my kingdom.

    - verse: >-
        yes, I joined the battle with him, and he and his army were defeated by us, and we sat on the throne of his kingdom— 
    - verse: >-
        now also let’s make friends with one another. Give me now your daughter as my wife. I will be joined with you, and will give both you and her gifts worthy of you.”

        Ptolemy the king answered, saying, “Happy is the day you returned to the land of your ancestors and sat on the throne of their kingdom. 
    - verse: >-
        Now I will do to you as you have written, but meet me at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; and I will join with you, even as you have said.”

    - verse: >-
        It came to pass, when those who complained against him saw his honor according to the proclamation, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled away. 
    - verse: >-
        The king gave him honor, and enrolled him among his chief friends, and made him a captain and governor of a province. 
    - verse: >-
        Then Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace and gladness.

    - verse: >-
        Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was over Coelesyria, and he gathered together a great army, and encamped against Jamnia, and sent to Jonathan the high priest, saying, 
    - verse: >-
        “You alone lift up yourself against us, but I am ridiculed and in reproach because of you. Why do you assume authority against us in the mountains? 
    - verse: >-
        Now therefore, if you trust in your forces, come down to us into the plain, and let’s match strength with each other there; for the power of the cities is with me. 
    - verse: >-
        Ask and learn who I am, and the rest who help us. They say, ‘Your foot can’t stand before our face; for your ancestors have been put to flight twice in their own land.’ 
    - verse: >-
        Now you won’t be able to withstand the cavalry and such an army as this in the plain, where is there is no stone or pebble, or place to flee.” 
    - verse: >-

    - verse: >-
        Then he encamped against Joppa. The people of the city shut him out, because Apollonius had a garrison in Joppa. 
    - verse: >-
        So they fought against it. The people of the city were afraid, and opened to him; and Jonathan became master of Joppa. 
    - verse: >-
        Apollonius heard about that, and he gathered an army of three thousand cavalry, and a great army, and went to Azotus as though he were on a journey, and at the same time advanced onward into the plain, because he had a multitude of cavalry which he trusted. 
    - verse: >-
        He pursued him to Azotus, and the armies joined battle. 
    - verse: >-
        Apollonius had secretly left a thousand cavalry behind them.

        Jonathan learned that there was an ambush behind him. They surrounded his army, and shot their arrows at the people, from morning until evening; 
    - verse: >-
        but the people stood fast, as Jonathan commanded them; and the enemy’s horses grew tired. 
    - verse: >-
        Then Simon brought forward his army and joined battle with the phalanx (for the cavalry were exhausted), and they were defeated by him and fled. 
    - verse: >-
        The cavalry were scattered in the plain. They fled to Azotus and entered into Beth-dagon, their idol’s temple, to save themselves.

        Jonathan burned Azotus and the cities around it and took their spoils. He burned the temple of Dagon and those who fled into it with fire.

    - verse: >-
        He went out into Syria with words of peace, and the people of the cities opened their gates to him and met him; for King Alexander’s command was that they should meet him, because he was his father-in-law.

        Now as he entered into the cities of Ptolemais, he set his forces for a garrison in each city.

        Now therefore you shall do well if you send me men who will fight for me; for all my forces have revolted.” 
    - verse: >-
        So Jonathan sent him three thousand valiant men to Antioch. They came to the king, and the king was glad at their coming. 
    - verse: >-
        The people of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of one hundred and twenty thousand men, and they wanted to kill the king. 
    - verse: >-
        The king fled into the court of the palace, and the people of the city seized the main streets of the city and began to fight. 
    - verse: >-
        The king called the Jews to help him, and they were gathered together to him all at once, and they dispersed themselves in the city, and killed that day about one hundred thousand. 
    - verse: >-
        They set the city on fire, and seized many spoils that day, and saved the king. 
    - verse: >-
        The people of the city saw that the Jews had taken control of the city as they pleased, and they became faint in their hearts, and they cried out to the king with supplication, saying, 
    - verse: >-
        “Give us your right hand, and let the Jews cease from fighting against us and the city.” 
    - verse: >-
        They threw away their weapons and made peace. The Jews were glorified in the sight of the king, and before all who were in his kingdom. Then they returned to Jerusalem, having much plunder. 
    - verse: >-
        So King Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him. 
    - verse: >-
        He lied in all that he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan, and didn’t repay him according to the benefits with which he had repaid him, and treated him very harshly. 
    - verse: >-
        Now after this, Tryphon returned, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned and put on a crown. 
    - verse: >-
        All the forces which Demetrius had sent away with disgrace were gathered to him, and they fought against him, and he fled and was routed. 
    - verse: >-
        Tryphon took the elephants, and took control of Antioch. 
    - verse: >-
        The young Antiochus wrote to Jonathan, saying, “I confirm to you the high priesthood, and appoint you over the four districts, and to be one of the king’s friends.” 
    - verse: >-
        He sent to him golden vessels and furniture for the table, and gave him permission to drink in golden vessels, and to be clothed in purple, and to have a golden buckle. 
    - verse: >-
        He made his brother Simon governor from the Ladder of Tyre to the borders of Egypt. 
    - verse: >-
        Jonathan went out and took his journey beyond the river and through the cities. All the forces of Syria gathered themselves to him to be his allies. He came to Ascalon, and the people of the city met him honorably. 
    - verse: >-
        He departed from there to Gaza, and the people of Gaza shut him out. So he besieged it and burned its pasture lands with fire, and plundered them. 
    - verse: >-
        The people of Gaza pleaded with Jonathan, and he gave them his right hand, and took the sons of their princes for hostages, and sent them away to Jerusalem. Then he passed through the country as far as Damascus. 
    - verse: >-
        Then Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes had come to Kedesh, which is in Galilee, with a great army, intending to remove him from his office. 
    - verse: >-
        He went to meet them, but he left Simon his brother in the country.

        Simon encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it many days, and hemmed it in. 
    - verse: >-
        They asked him to give them his right hand, and he gave it to them. He removed them from there, took possession of the city, and set a garrison over it. 
    - verse: >-
        Jonathan and his army encamped at the water of Gennesareth, and early in the morning they marched to the plain of Hazor. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, an army of foreigners met him in the plain. They laid an ambush for him in the mountains, but they themselves met him face to face. 
    - verse: >-
        But those who lay in ambush rose out of their places and joined battle. All those who were on Jonathan’s side fled. 
    - verse: >-
        Not one of them was left, except Mattathias the son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Chalphi, captains of the forces. 
    - verse: >-
        Jonathan tore his clothes, put dirt on his head, and prayed. 
    - verse: >-
        He turned again to them in battle, and routed them, and they fled. 
    - verse: >-
        When the men on his side who had fled saw this, they returned to him and pursued with him to Kedesh to their camp, and they encamped there.

    - verse: >-
        Even before this time letters were sent to Onias the high priest from Arius, who was reigning among you, to signify that you are our kindred, as the copy written below shows. 
    - verse: >-
        Onias welcomed honorably the man who was sent and received the letters, wherein declaration was made of alliance and friendship.

        Therefore we also, even though we need none of these things, having for our encouragement the holy books which are in our hands, 
    - verse: >-
        have undertaken to send that we might renew our brotherhood and friendship with you, to the end that we should not become estranged from you altogether; for a long time has passed since you sent your letter to us. 
    - verse: >-
        We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our feasts, and on the other convenient days, remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as it is right and proper to be mindful of kindred. 
    - verse: >-
        Moreover, we are glad for your glory. 
    - verse: >-
        But as for ourselves, many afflictions and many wars have encompassed us, and the kings who are around us have fought against us. 
    - verse: >-
        We were unwilling to be troublesome to you, and to the rest of our allies and friends, in these wars; 
    - verse: >-
        for we have the help which is from heaven to help us, and we have been delivered from our enemies, and our enemies have been humbled. 
    - verse: >-
        We chose therefore Numenius the son of Antiochus and Antipater the son of Jason, and have sent them to the Romans, to renew the friendship that we had with them, and the former alliance. 
    - verse: >-
        We commanded them therefore to go also to you, and to salute you, and to deliver you our letters concerning the renewing of friendship and our brotherhood.

        And now you will do well if you give us a reply.”

        And this is the copy of the letters which they sent to Onias:

        It has been found in writing, concerning the Spartans and the Jews, that they are kindred, and that they are of the descendants of Abraham. 
    - verse: >-
        Now, since this has come to our knowledge, you will do well to write to us of your prosperity. 
    - verse: >-
        We moreover write on our part to you, that your livestock and goods are ours, and ours are yours. We do command therefore that they make report to you accordingly.” 
    - verse: >-
        Now Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes had returned to fight against him with a greater army than before, 
    - verse: >-
        so he marched away from Jerusalem, and met them in the country of Hamath; for he gave them no opportunity to set foot in his country. 
    - verse: >-
        He sent spies into his camp, and they came again, and reported to him that they were preparing to attack them at night. 
    - verse: >-
        But as soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded his men to watch, and to be armed, that all the night long they might be ready for battle. He stationed sentinels around the camp. 
    - verse: >-
        The adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men were ready for battle, and they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their camp then withdrew. 
    - verse: >-
        But Jonathan and his men didn’t know it until the morning; for they saw the fires burning. 
    - verse: >-
        Jonathan pursued after them, but didn’t overtake them; for they had gone over the river Eleutherus. 
    - verse: >-
        Then Jonathan turned toward the Arabians, who are called Zabadaeans, and struck them, and took their spoils. 
    - verse: >-
        He came out from there, and came to Damascus, and took his journey through all the country. 
    - verse: >-
        Simon went out, and took his journey as far as Ascalon, and the strongholds that were near it. Then he turned toward Joppa and took possession of it; 
    - verse: >-
        for he had heard that they were planning to hand over the stronghold to Demetrius’ men. He set a garrison there to guard it. 
    - verse: >-
        Then Jonathan returned and called the elders of the people together. He planned with them to build strongholds in Judea, 
    - verse: >-
        and to make the walls of Jerusalem higher, and to raise a great mound between the citadel and the city, to separate it from the city, that so it might be isolated, that its garrison might neither buy nor sell. 
    - verse: >-
        They were gathered together to build the city. Part of the wall of the brook that is on the east side fell down, and he repaired the section called Chaphenatha. 
    - verse: >-
        Simon also built Adida in the plain country, made it strong, and set up gates and bars. 
    - verse: >-
        And Tryphon sought to reign over Asia and to crown himself, and to stretch out his hand against Antiochus the king. 
    - verse: >-
        He was afraid that Jonathan wouldn’t allow him, and that he would fight against him; and he sought a way to seize him, that he might destroy him. So he marched out and came to Bethshan. 
    - verse: >-
        Jonathan came out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for battle, and came to Bethshan. 
    - verse: >-
        Tryphon saw that he came with a great army, and he was afraid to stretch out his hand against him. 
    - verse: >-
        He received him honorably, and commended him to all his friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his forces to be obedient to him, as to himself. 
    - verse: >-
        He said to Jonathan, “Why have you put all this people to so much trouble, seeing there is no war between us? 
    - verse: >-
        Now send them away to their homes, but choose for yourself a few men who shall be with you, and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will give it to you, and the rest of the strongholds and the rest of the forces, and all the king’s officers. Then I will turn around and depart; for this is why I came.” 
    - verse: >-
        He put his trust in him, and did even as he said, and sent away his forces, and they departed into the land of Judah. 
    - verse: >-
        But he reserved to himself three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, but one thousand went with him. 
    - verse: >-
        Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais shut the gates and seized him. They killed all those who came in with him with the sword. 
    - verse: >-
        Tryphon sent troops and cavalry into Galilee, and into the Great Plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s men. 
    - verse: >-
        They perceived that he had been seized and had perished, along with those who were with him. They encouraged one another and went on their way close together, prepared to fight. 
    - verse: >-
        Those who followed them saw that they were ready to fight for their lives, and turned back again. 
    - verse: >-
        They all came in peace into the land of Judah, and they mourned for Jonathan and those who were with him, and they were very afraid. All Israel mourned with a great mourning. 
    - verse: >-
        And all the Gentiles who were around them sought to destroy them utterly; for they said, “They have no ruler nor anyone to help them. Now therefore let’s fight against them, and take away their memory from among men.”

    - verse: >-
        He encouraged them, and said to them, “You yourselves know all the things that I, my kindred, and my father’s house have done for the laws and the sanctuary, and the battles and the distresses which we have seen. 
    - verse: >-
        Because of this, all my brothers have perished for Israel’s sake, and I am left alone. 
    - verse: >-
        Now be it far from me, that I should spare my own life in any time of affliction, for I am not better than my kindred. 
    - verse: >-
        However, I will take vengeance for my nation, for the sanctuary, and for our wives and children, because all the Gentiles have gathered out of hatred to destroy us.”

        Fight our battles, and we will do all that you tell us to do.”

        But Simon encamped at Adida, near the plain. 
    - verse: >-
        Tryphon knew that Simon had risen up in the place of his brother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, so he sent ambassadors to him, saying,

        “It is for money which Jonathan your brother owed to the king’s treasury, by reason of the offices which he had, that we are detaining him. 
    - verse: >-
        Now send one hundred talents of silver and two of his sons for hostages, so that when he is released he may not revolt against us, and we will release him.” 
    - verse: >-
        Simon knew that they spoke to him deceitfully, but he sent to get the money and the children, lest perhaps he would arouse great hostility among the people, 
    - verse: >-
        who might say, “Because I didn’t send him the money and the children, he perished.” 
    - verse: >-
        So he sent the children and the hundred talents, but Tryphon lied, and didn’t release Jonathan. 
    - verse: >-
        After this, Tryphon came to invade the land and destroy it, and he went around by the way that leads to Adora. Simon and his army marched near him to every place, wherever he went. 
    - verse: >-
        Now the people of the citadel sent to Tryphon ambassadors, urging him to come to them through the wilderness, and to send them food. 
    - verse: >-
        So Tryphon prepared all his cavalry to come, but on that night a very heavy snow fell, and he didn’t come because of the snow. He marched off and went into the land of Gilead. 
    - verse: >-
        When he came near to Bascama, he killed Jonathan, and he was buried there. 
    - verse: >-
        Then Tryphon turned back, and went away into his own land.

        Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried him at Modin, the city of his fathers.

        For these, he made an elaborate setting, erecting great pillars around them, and upon the pillars he made suits of armor for a perpetual memorial, and beside the suits of armor, he carved ships, so that they could be seen by all who sail on the sea.

        This is the tomb which he made at Modin. It remains to this day.

        King Demetrius sent to him according to these words, and answered him, and wrote a letter to him, as follows:

        “King Demetrius to Simon the high priest and friend of kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews, greetings. 
    - verse: >-
        The golden crown and the palm branch, which you sent, we have received. We are ready to make a steadfast peace with you, yes, and to write to our officers to release you from tribute. 
    - verse: >-
        Whatever things we confirmed to you, they are confirmed. The strongholds, which you have built, let them be your own. 
    - verse: >-
        As for any oversights and faults committed to this day, we forgive them, and the crown tax which you owed us. If there were any other tax collected in Jerusalem, let it be collected no longer.

        If any among you are qualified to be enrolled in our court, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.”

    - verse: >-
        Those who were in the engine leaped out into the city; and there was a great uproar in the city. 
    - verse: >-
        The people of the city tore their clothes, and went up on the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, asking Simon to give them his right hand. 
    - verse: >-
        They said, “Don’t deal with us according to our wickednesses, but according to your mercy.” 
    - verse: >-
        So Simon was reconciled to them, and didn’t fight against them; but he expelled them from the city and cleansed the houses where the idols were, and then entered into it with singing and giving praise. 
    - verse: >-
        He removed all uncleanness out of it, and placed in it men who would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before, and built a dwelling place for himself in it. 
    - verse: >-
        But the people of the citadel in Jerusalem were hindered from going out and from going into the country, and from buying and selling. So they were very hungry, and a great number of them perished from famine. 
    - verse: >-

        He entered into it on the twenty-third day of the second month, in the one hundred seventy-first year, with praise and palm branches, with harps, with cymbals, and with stringed instruments, with hymns, and with songs, because a great enemy had been destroyed out of Israel.
