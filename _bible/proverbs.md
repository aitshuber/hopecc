  verses:
    - verse: >-
        The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel: 
    - verse: >-
        to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding; 
    - verse: >-
        to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; 
    - verse: >-
        to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man— 
    - verse: >-
        that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel; 
    - verse: >-
        to understand a proverb and parables, the words and riddles of the wise. 
    - verse: >-
        The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge, but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction. 
    - verse: >-
        My son, listen to your father’s instruction, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching; 
    - verse: >-
        for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains around your neck. 
    - verse: >-
        My son, if sinners entice you, don’t consent. 
    - verse: >-
        If they say, “Come with us. Let’s lie in wait for blood. Let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause. 
    - verse: >-
        Let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down into the pit. 
    - verse: >-
        We’ll find all valuable wealth. We’ll fill our houses with plunder. 
    - verse: >-
        You shall cast your lot among us. We’ll all have one purse”— 
    - verse: >-
        my son, don’t walk on the path with them. Keep your foot from their path, 
    - verse: >-
        for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood. 
    - verse: >-
        For the net is spread in vain in the sight of any bird; 
    - verse: >-
        but these lay in wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives. 
    - verse: >-
        So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners. 
    - verse: >-
        Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares. 
    - verse: >-
        She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words: 
    - verse: >-
        “How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge? 
    - verse: >-
        Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you. 
    - verse: >-
        Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention; 
    - verse: >-
        but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof; 
    - verse: >-
        I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you, 
    - verse: >-
        when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come on you. 
    - verse: >-
        Then they will call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me, 
    - verse: >-
        because they hated knowledge, and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh. 
    - verse: >-
        They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes. 
    - verse: >-
        For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them. 
    - verse: >-
        But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm.” 
- chapter: 2
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my commandments within you, 
    - verse: >-
        so as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding; 
    - verse: >-
        yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your voice for understanding; 
    - verse: >-
        if you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures; 
    - verse: >-
        then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God. 
    - verse: >-
        For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. 
    - verse: >-
        He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity, 
    - verse: >-
        that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his saints. 
    - verse: >-
        Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and every good path. 
    - verse: >-
        For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 
    - verse: >-
        Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you, 
    - verse: >-
        to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things, 
    - verse: >-
        who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness, 
    - verse: >-
        who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil, 
    - verse: >-
        who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths, 
    - verse: >-
        to deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words, 
    - verse: >-
        who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God; 
    - verse: >-
        for her house leads down to death, her paths to the departed spirits. 
    - verse: >-
        None who go to her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 
    - verse: >-
        For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it. 
    - verse: >-
        But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it. 
- chapter: 3
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        My son, don’t forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, 
    - verse: >-
        for they will add to you length of days, years of life, and peace. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart. 
    - verse: >-
        So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 
    - verse: >-
        Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don’t lean on your own understanding. 
    - verse: >-
        In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil. 
    - verse: >-
        It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones. 
    - verse: >-
        Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits of all your increase; 
    - verse: >-
        so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine. 
    - verse: >-
        My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline, neither be weary of his correction; 
    - verse: >-
        for whom Yahweh loves, he corrects, even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights. 
    - verse: >-
        Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding. 
    - verse: >-
        For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her return is better than fine gold. 
    - verse: >-
        She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her. 
    - verse: >-
        Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor. 
    - verse: >-
        Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace. 
    - verse: >-
        She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her. 
    - verse: >-
        By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens. 
    - verse: >-
        By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew. 
    - verse: >-
        My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion, 
    - verse: >-
        so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck. 
    - verse: >-
        Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won’t stumble. 
    - verse: >-
        When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes; 
    - verse: >-
        for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; tomorrow I will give it to you,” when you have it by you. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells securely by you. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways. 
    - verse: >-
        For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship is with the upright. 
    - verse: >-
        Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous. 
    - verse: >-
        Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble. 
    - verse: >-
        The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion of fools. 
- chapter: 4
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. Pay attention and know understanding; 
    - verse: >-
        for I give you sound learning. Don’t forsake my law. 
    - verse: >-
        For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child in the sight of my mother. 
    - verse: >-
        He taught me, and said to me: “Let your heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live. 
    - verse: >-
        Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don’t forget, and don’t deviate from the words of my mouth. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you. 
    - verse: >-
        Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding. 
    - verse: >-
        Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor when you embrace her. 
    - verse: >-
        She will give to your head a garland of grace. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.” 
    - verse: >-
        Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many. 
    - verse: >-
        I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths. 
    - verse: >-
        When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble. 
    - verse: >-
        Take firm hold of instruction. Don’t let her go. Keep her, for she is your life. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. Don’t walk in the way of evil men. 
    - verse: >-
        Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on. 
    - verse: >-
        For they don’t sleep unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall. 
    - verse: >-
        For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 
    - verse: >-
        But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light that shines more and more until the perfect day. 
    - verse: >-
        The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don’t know what they stumble over. 
    - verse: >-
        My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings. 
    - verse: >-
        Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the center of your heart. 
    - verse: >-
        For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole body. 
    - verse: >-
        Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the wellspring of life. 
    - verse: >-
        Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you. 
    - verse: >-
        Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you. 
    - verse: >-
        Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil. 
- chapter: 5
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding, 
    - verse: >-
        that you may maintain discretion, that your lips may preserve knowledge. 
    - verse: >-
        For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil, 
    - verse: >-
        but in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword. 
    - verse: >-
        Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol. 
    - verse: >-
        She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it. 
    - verse: >-
        Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don’t depart from the words of my mouth. 
    - verse: >-
        Remove your way far from her. Don’t come near the door of her house, 
    - verse: >-
        lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one; 
    - verse: >-
        lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich another man’s house. 
    - verse: >-
        You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your body are consumed, 
    - verse: >-
        and say, “How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof. 
    - verse: >-
        I haven’t obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me! 
    - verse: >-
        I have come to the brink of utter ruin, among the gathered assembly.” 
    - verse: >-
        Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of your own well. 
    - verse: >-
        Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares? 
    - verse: >-
        Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you. 
    - verse: >-
        Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 
    - verse: >-
        A loving doe and a graceful deer— let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love. 
    - verse: >-
        For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another? 
    - verse: >-
        For the ways of man are before Yahweh’s eyes. He examines all his paths. 
    - verse: >-
        The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly. 
    - verse: >-
        He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray. 
- chapter: 6
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger, 
    - verse: >-
        you are trapped by the words of your mouth; you are ensnared with the words of your mouth. 
    - verse: >-
        Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor. 
    - verse: >-
        Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids. 
    - verse: >-
        Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler. 
    - verse: >-
        Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise; 
    - verse: >-
        which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, 
    - verse: >-
        provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest. 
    - verse: >-
        How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep? 
    - verse: >-
        A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep— 
    - verse: >-
        so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity as an armed man. 
    - verse: >-
        A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth, 
    - verse: >-
        who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers, 
    - verse: >-
        in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who always sows discord. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy. 
    - verse: >-
        There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are an abomination to him: 
    - verse: >-
        arrogant eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, 
    - verse: >-
        a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief, 
    - verse: >-
        a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers. 
    - verse: >-
        My son, keep your father’s commandment, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching. 
    - verse: >-
        Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck. 
    - verse: >-
        When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you. 
    - verse: >-
        For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life, 
    - verse: >-
        to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her captivate you with her eyelids. 
    - verse: >-
        For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life. 
    - verse: >-
        Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned? 
    - verse: >-
        Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? 
    - verse: >-
        So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished. 
    - verse: >-
        Men don’t despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry, 
    - verse: >-
        but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house. 
    - verse: >-
        He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul. 
    - verse: >-
        He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away. 
    - verse: >-
        For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won’t spare in the day of vengeance. 
    - verse: >-
        He won’t regard any ransom, neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts. 
- chapter: 7
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        My son, keep my words. Lay up my commandments within you. 
    - verse: >-
        Keep my commandments and live! Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye. 
    - verse: >-
        Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart. 
    - verse: >-
        Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.” Call understanding your relative, 
    - verse: >-
        that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words. 
    - verse: >-
        For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice. 
    - verse: >-
        I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding, 
    - verse: >-
        passing through the street near her corner, he went the way to her house, 
    - verse: >-
        in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness. 
    - verse: >-
        Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, and with crafty intent. 
    - verse: >-
        She is loud and defiant. Her feet don’t stay in her house. 
    - verse: >-
        Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking at every corner. 
    - verse: >-
        So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him: 
    - verse: >-
        “Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. Today I have paid my vows. 
    - verse: >-
        Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face, and I have found you. 
    - verse: >-
        I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. 
    - verse: >-
        I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
    - verse: >-
        Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning. Let’s solace ourselves with loving. 
    - verse: >-
        For my husband isn’t at home. He has gone on a long journey. 
    - verse: >-
        He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.” 
    - verse: >-
        With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him. 
    - verse: >-
        He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, as a fool stepping into a noose. 
    - verse: >-
        Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries to the snare, and doesn’t know that it will cost his life. 
    - verse: >-
        Now therefore, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth. 
    - verse: >-
        Don’t let your heart turn to her ways. Don’t go astray in her paths, 
    - verse: >-
        for she has thrown down many wounded. Yes, all her slain are a mighty army. 
    - verse: >-
        Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death. 
- chapter: 8
  verses:
    - verse: >-
        Doesn’t wisdom cry out? Doesn’t understanding raise her voice? 
    - verse: >-
        On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she stands. 
    - verse: >-
        Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors, she cries aloud: 
    - verse: >-
        “I call to you men! I send my voice to the sons of mankind. 
    - verse: >-
        You simple, understand prudence! You fools, be of an understanding heart! 
    - verse: >-
        Hear, for I will speak excellent things. The opening of my lips is for right things. 
    - verse: >-
